<p>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</p>

<p>As is well documented, Emily Dickinson's poems were edited in these
early editions by her friends, better to fit the conventions of the
times. In particular, her dashes, often small enough to appear
as dots, became commas and semi-colons.</p>

<p>In the second series of poems published, a facsimile of her
handwritten poem which her editors titled <a href="#There_came_a_day_at_summers_full">"Renunciation"</a> is given,
and comparing this to the printed version gives a flavor of the
changes made in these early editions.</p>

<p>PREFACE.</p>

<p>The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson
long since called "the Poetry of the Portfolio,"&mdash;something produced
absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of
expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably
forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism
and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it
may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the
unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the
present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she
must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,
literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the
doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly
limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,
like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with
great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her
lifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great
abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all
conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,
and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own
tenacious fastidiousness.</p>

<p>Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died
there May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the
leading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known
college there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large
reception at his house, attended by all the families connected with
the institution and by the leading people of the town. On these
occasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and
did her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from
her manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence.
The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,
and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if
she had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded
with her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and
brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as
Undine or Mignon or Thekla.</p>

<p>This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her
personal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is
believed that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a
quality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of
anything to be elsewhere found,&mdash;flashes of wholly original and
profound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting
an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet
often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are
here published as they were written, with very few and superficial
changes; although it is fair to say that the titles have been
assigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these
verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with
rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and
a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the
few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at
the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can
delineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental
struggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,
sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the
reader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these
poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an
uneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really
unsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one's
breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin
wrote in his earlier and better days, "No weight nor mass nor beauty
of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought."</p>

This is my letter to the world,<br>

The simple news that Nature told,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With tender majesty.<br>
<br>
Her message is committed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hands I cannot see;<br>
For love of her, sweet countrymen,<br>

<br>
Success is counted sweetest<br>
By those who ne'er succeed.<br>
To comprehend a nectar<br>
Requires sorest need.<br>
<br>
Not one of all the purple host<br>
Who took the flag to-day<br>
Can tell the definition,<br>
So clear, of victory,<br>
<br>
As he, defeated, dying,<br>
On whose forbidden ear<br>
The distant strains of triumph<br>
Break, agonized and clear!<br>

Life is but life, and death but death!<br>
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!<br>
And if, indeed, I fail,<br>
At least to know the worst is sweet.<br>
Defeat means nothing but defeat,<br>
No drearier can prevail!<br>

Till the children ask, "But the forty?<br>

And a softness the teller's eye;<br>
And the children no further question,<br>

'T is but the ecstasy of death,<br>

The smitten rock that gushes,<br>
The trampled steel that springs;<br>

Mirth is the mail of anguish,<br>

Lest anybody spy the blood<br>

A precious, mouldering pleasure 't is<br>
To meet an antique book,<br>
In just the dress his century wore;<br>
A privilege, I think,<br>
<br>
His venerable hand to take,<br>
And warming in our own,<br>
A passage back, or two, to make<br>
To times when he was young.<br>
<br>
His quaint opinions to inspect,<br>
His knowledge to unfold<br>
On what concerns our mutual mind,<br>
The literature of old;<br>
<br>
What interested scholars most,<br>
What competitions ran<br>
When Plato was a certainty.<br>
And Sophocles a man;<br>
<br>
When Sappho was a living girl,<br>
And Beatrice wore<br>
The gown that Dante deified.<br>
Facts, centuries before,<br>
<br>
He traverses familiar,<br>
As one should come to town<br>
And tell you all your dreams were true;<br>
He lived where dreams were sown.<br>
<br>
His presence is enchantment,<br>
You beg him not to go;<br>
Old volumes shake their vellum heads<br>
And tantalize, just so.<br>

Then shuts the door;<br>
On her divine majority<br>
Obtrude no more.<br>

Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing<br>
At her low gate;<br>
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling<br>
Upon her mat.<br>

I've known her from an ample nation<br>
Choose one;<br>
Then close the valves of her attention<br>
Like stone.<br>

THE LONELY HOUSE.<br>
<br>
I know some lonely houses off the road<br>
A robber 'd like the look of, &mdash;<br>
Wooden barred,<br>
And windows hanging low,<br>
Inviting to<br>
A portico,<br>
Where two could creep:<br>
One hand the tools,<br>
The other peep<br>
To make sure all's asleep.<br>
Old-fashioned eyes,<br>
Not easy to surprise!<br>
<br>
How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,<br>
With just a clock, &mdash;<br>
But they could gag the tick,<br>
And mice won't bark;<br>
And so the walls don't tell,<br>
None will.<br>
<br>
A pair of spectacles ajar just stir &mdash;<br>
An almanac's aware.<br>
Was it the mat winked,<br>
Or a nervous star?<br>
The moon slides down the stair<br>
To see who's there.<br>
<br>
There's plunder, &mdash; where?<br>
Tankard, or spoon,<br>
Earring, or stone,<br>
A watch, some ancient brooch<br>
To match the grandmamma,<br>
Staid sleeping there.<br>
<br>
Day rattles, too,<br>
Stealth's slow;<br>
The sun has got as far<br>
As the third sycamore.<br>
Screams chanticleer,<br>
"Who's there?"<br>
And echoes, trains away,<br>
Sneer &mdash; "Where?"<br>
While the old couple, just astir,<br>
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!<br>

Pain has an element of blank;<br>
It cannot recollect<br>
When it began, or if there were<br>
A day when it was not.<br>

Its past, enlightened to perceive<br>
New periods of pain.<br>

And debauchee of dew,<br>
Reeling, through endless summer days,<br>
From inns of molten blue.<br>

When landlords turn the drunken bee<br>
Out of the foxglove's door,<br>
When butterflies renounce their drams,<br>
I shall but drink the more!<br>

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,<br>
And saints to windows run,<br>
To see the little tippler<br>

Doubt me, my dim companion!<br>

With but a fraction of the love<br>
Poured thee without a stint.<br>
The whole of me, forever,<br>
What more the woman can, &mdash;<br>
Say quick, that I may dower thee<br>
With last delight I own!<br>
<br>
It cannot be my spirit,<br>
For that was thine before;<br>
I ceded all of dust I knew, &mdash;<br>
What opulence the more<br>
Had I, a humble maiden,<br>
Whose farthest of degree<br>
Was that she might,<br>
Some distant heaven,<br>
Dwell timidly with thee!<br>

I'd wind the months in balls,<br>
And put them each in separate drawers,<br>

I'd count them on my hand,<br>
Subtracting till my fingers dropped<br>
Into Van Diemen's land.<br>

If certain, when this life was out,<br>
That yours and mine should be,<br>
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,<br>
And taste eternity.<br>

But now, all ignorant of the length<br>
Of time's uncertain wing,<br>
It goads me, like the goblin bee,<br>

There came a day at summer's full<br>
Entirely for me;<br>
I thought that such were for the saints,<br>
Where revelations be.<br>

The sun, as common, went abroad,<br>
The flowers, accustomed, blew,<br>
As if no soul the solstice passed<br>
That maketh all things new.<br>
<br>
The time was scarce profaned by speech;<br>
The symbol of a word<br>
Was needless, as at sacrament<br>
The wardrobe of our Lord.<br>
<br>
Each was to each the sealed church,<br>
Permitted to commune this time,<br>
Lest we too awkward show<br>
At supper of the Lamb.<br>
<br>
The hours slid fast, as hours will,<br>
Clutched tight by greedy hands;<br>
So faces on two decks look back,<br>
Bound to opposing lands.<br>
<br>
And so, when all the time had failed,<br>
Without external sound,<br>
Each bound the other's crucifix,<br>
We gave no other bond.<br>
<br>
Sufficient troth that we shall rise &mdash;<br>
Deposed, at length, the grave &mdash;<br>
To that new marriage, justified<br>
Through Calvaries of Love!<br>

Baptized before without the choice,<br>
But this time consciously, of grace<br>
Unto supremest name,<br>
Called to my full, the crescent dropped,<br>
Existence's whole arc filled up<br>
With one small diadem.<br>

My second rank, too small the first,<br>
Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,<br>
A half unconscious queen;<br>

There seemed a purple stile<br>
Which little yellow boys and girls<br>

Till when they reached the other side,<br>
A dominie in gray<br>
Put gently up the evening bars,<br>

Permitted gods and me.<br>

And thrum upon the door,<br>
And birds take places overhead,<br>
To bear them orchestra,<br>

I crave him grace, of summer boughs,<br>
If such an outcast be,<br>
He never heard that fleshless chant<br>
Rise solemn in the tree,<br>

That men must slake in wilderness,<br>
Or in the desert cloy, &mdash;<br>
An instinct for the hoar, the bald,<br>
Lapland's necessity.<br>
<br>
The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;<br>
The gnash of northern winds<br>
Is sweetest nutriment to him,<br>
His best Norwegian wines.<br>

To satin races he is nought;<br>
But children on the Don<br>
Beneath his tabernacles play,<br>
And Dnieper wrestlers run.<br>

An imperial affliction<br>

On the look of death.<br>

No dew upon the grass,<br>
But only on my forehead stopped,<br>
And wandered in my face.<br>

My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,<br>
My fingers were awake;<br>
Yet why so little sound myself<br>
Unto my seeming make?<br>
<br>
How well I knew the light before!<br>
I could not see it now.<br>
'T is dying, I am doing; but<br>
I'm not afraid to know.<br>

<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's
poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern
artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the
qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest
themes,&mdash;life and love and death. That "irresistible needle-touch,"
as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very
core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as
it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling
power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to
form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.</p>

<p>Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending
occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of
her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend "H.H."
must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th
September, 1884, she wrote:&mdash;</p>


<p class="indent">MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash; What portfolios full of verses
you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your "day and
generation" that you will not give them light.</p>

<p class="indent">If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive
you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee
and executor. Surely after you are what is called
"dead" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you
have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your
verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think
we have a right to withhold from the world a word or
a thought any more than a deed which might help a
single soul. . . .</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly yours,</p>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HELEN JACKSON.</p>


<p>The "portfolios" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,
by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had
been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little
fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear
evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had
received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of
rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and
phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one
form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without
important exception, her friends have generously placed at the
disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and
these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several
renderings of the same verse.</p>

<p>To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been
subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They
should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and
suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some
time in the finished picture.</p>

<p>Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the
winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the
April following, she says, "I made no verse, but one or two, until
this winter."</p>

<p>The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running
Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in
breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her
latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its
fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,
everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous
dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of
a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and
strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of
the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,
the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general
chronologic accuracy.</p>

<p>As a rule, the verses were without titles; but "A Country Burial,"
"A Thunder-Storm," "The Humming-Bird," and a few others were named
by their author, frequently at the end,&mdash;sometimes only in the
accompanying note, if sent to a friend.</p>

<p>The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in
pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of
responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not
absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her
rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it
seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and
more usual rhymes.</p>

<p>Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very
absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily
Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a
particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of
inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and
the "thought-rhyme" appears frequently,&mdash;appealing, indeed, to an
unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.</p>

<p>Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.
Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the
sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She
touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost
humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is
never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic
has said, she may exhibit toward God "an Emersonian self-possession,"
it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced
as it is rare.</p>

<p>She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She
was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no
love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature
introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist
in pretence.</p>

<p>Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and
bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted
human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the
first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of
pope; the first red leaf hurrying through "the altered air," an
epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or
melancholy, she lived in its presence.</p>

I meant to have but modest needs,<br>
Such as content, and heaven;<br>
Within my income these could lie,<br>

But since the last included both,<br>

But just for one to stipulate,<br>

Great Spirit, give to me<br>
A heaven not so large as yours,<br>

To learn the transport by the pain,<br>
As blind men learn the sun;<br>
To die of thirst, suspecting<br>
That brooks in meadows run;<br>

To stay the homesick, homesick feet<br>
Upon a foreign shore<br>
Haunted by native lands, the while,<br>
And blue, beloved air &mdash;<br>

This is the sovereign anguish,<br>
This, the signal woe!<br>
These are the patient laureates<br>
Whose voices, trained below,<br>

RETURNING.<br>
<br>
I years had been from home,<br>
And now, before the door,<br>
I dared not open, lest a face<br>
I never saw before<br>
<br>
Stare vacant into mine<br>
And ask my business there.<br>
My business, &mdash; just a life I left,<br>
Was such still dwelling there?<br>
<br>
I fumbled at my nerve,<br>
I scanned the windows near;<br>
The silence like an ocean rolled,<br>
And broke against my ear.<br>
<br>
I laughed a wooden laugh<br>
That I could fear a door,<br>
Who danger and the dead had faced,<br>
But never quaked before.<br>
<br>
I fitted to the latch<br>
My hand, with trembling care,<br>
Lest back the awful door should spring,<br>
And leave me standing there.<br>
<br>
I moved my fingers off<br>
As cautiously as glass,<br>
And held my ears, and like a thief<br>
Fled gasping from the house.<br>

PRAYER.<br>

Prayer is the little implement<br>
Through which men reach<br>
Where presence is denied them.<br>
They fling their speech<br>

By means of it in God's ear;<br>

This sums the apparatus<br>

Somewhere, in silence.<br>
He has hid his rare life<br>
From our gross eyes.<br>

'T is an instant's play,<br>
'T is a fond ambush,<br>
Just to make bliss<br>
Earn her own surprise!<br>
<br>
But should the play<br>
Prove piercing earnest,<br>
Should the glee glaze<br>
In death's stiff stare,<br>
<br>
Would not the fun<br>
Look too expensive?<br>
Would not the jest<br>
Have crawled too far?<br>

Such transport breaks upon the town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it that "new life!"<br>

It is not bird, it has no nest;<br>

It is not hymn from pulpit read, &mdash;<br>
The morning stars the treble led<br>

Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;<br>
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,<br>
So you could see what moved them so.<br>
<br>
"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,<br>
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;<br>
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,<br>
As if it held but the might of a child;<br>
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.<br>
Tell him &mdash; No, you may quibble there,<br>
For it would split his heart to know it,<br>
And then you and I were silenter.<br>
<br>
"Tell him night finished before we finished,<br>
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'<br>
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended &mdash;<br>
What could it hinder so, to say?<br>
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,<br>
But if he ask where you are hid<br>
Until to-morrow, &mdash; happy letter!<br>

Where parties, phantom as herself,<br>
To Nowhere seemed to go<br>
In purposeless circumference,<br>
As 't were a tropic show.<br>

And notwithstanding bee that worked,<br>
And flower that zealous blew,<br>
This audience of idleness<br>
Disdained them, from the sky,<br>

"Which in the valleys lie?"<br>
Some shook their heads, and others smiled,<br>
And no one made reply.<br>
<br>
"Perhaps they did not hear," I said;<br>
"I will inquire again.<br>
Whose are the beds, the tiny beds<br>
So thick upon the plain?"<br>
<br>
"'T is daisy in the shortest;<br>
A little farther on,<br>
Nearest the door to wake the first,<br>
Little leontodon.<br>
<br>
"'T is iris, sir, and aster,<br>
Anemone and bell,<br>
Batschia in the blanket red,<br>
And chubby daffodil."<br>
<br>
Meanwhile at many cradles<br>
Her busy foot she plied,<br>
Humming the quaintest lullaby<br>
That ever rocked a child.<br>
<br>
"Hush! Epigea wakens! &mdash;<br>
The crocus stirs her lids,<br>
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, &mdash;<br>
She's dreaming of the woods."<br>
<br>
Then, turning from them, reverent,<br>
"Their bed-time 't is," she said;<br>
"The bumble-bees will wake them<br>
When April woods are red."<br>

Bees' exclusive coterie.<br>

Venice could not show a cheek<br>
Of a tint so lustrous meek.<br>
Never such an ambuscade<br>
As of brier and leaf displayed<br>
For my little damask maid.<br>
I had rather wear her grace<br>

Royalty enough for me<br>

THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.<br>

To hear an oriole sing<br>
May be a common thing,<br>
Or only a divine.<br>
<br>
It is not of the bird<br>
Who sings the same, unheard,<br>
As unto crowd.<br>
<br>
The fashion of the ear<br>
Attireth that it hear<br>
In dun or fair.<br>
<br>
So whether it be rune,<br>
Or whether it be none,<br>

Who failed to touch us all,<br>
Was that confiding prodigal,<br>
The blissful oriole.<br>

So drunk, he disavows it<br>
With badinage divine;<br>
So dazzling, we mistake him<br>
For an alighting mine.<br>

A pleader, a dissembler,<br>
An epicure, a thief, &mdash;<br>
Betimes an oratorio,<br>
An ecstasy in chief;<br>
<br>
The Jesuit of orchards,<br>
He cheats as he enchants<br>
Of an entire attar<br>
For his decamping wants.<br>

The meteor of birds,<br>
Departing like a pageant<br>
Of ballads and of bards.<br>

Till that first shout got by,<br>
Not all pianos in the woods<br>
Had power to mangle me.<br>
<br>
I dared not meet the daffodils,<br>
For fear their yellow gown<br>
Would pierce me with a fashion<br>
So foreign to my own.<br>
<br>
I wished the grass would hurry,<br>
So when 't was time to see,<br>
He 'd be too tall, the tallest one<br>
Could stretch to look at me.<br>

I could not bear the bees should come,<br>
I wished they 'd stay away<br>
In those dim countries where they go:<br>
What word had they for me?<br>
<br>
They 're here, though; not a creature failed,<br>
No blossom stayed away<br>
In gentle deference to me,<br>
The Queen of Calvary.<br>
<br>
Each one salutes me as he goes,<br>
And I my childish plumes<br>
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment<br>
Of their unthinking drums.<br>

BY THE SEA.<br>

I started early, took my dog,<br>
And visited the sea;<br>
The mermaids in the basement<br>
Came out to look at me,<br>
<br>
And frigates in the upper floor<br>
Extended hempen hands,<br>
Presuming me to be a mouse<br>
Aground, upon the sands.<br>
<br>
But no man moved me till the tide<br>
Went past my simple shoe,<br>
And past my apron and my belt,<br>
And past my bodice too,<br>
<br>
And made as he would eat me up<br>
As wholly as a dew<br>
Upon a dandelion's sleeve &mdash;<br>
And then I started too.<br>
<br>
And he &mdash; he followed close behind;<br>
I felt his silver heel<br>
Upon my ankle, &mdash; then my shoes<br>
Would overflow with pearl.<br>
<br>
Until we met the solid town,<br>
No man he seemed to know;<br>
And bowing with a mighty look<br>
At me, the sea withdrew.<br>

And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.<br>

He did not know I saw;<br>
He bit an angle-worm in halves<br>
And ate the fellow, raw.<br>
<br>
And then he drank a dew<br>
From a convenient grass,<br>
And then hopped sidewise to the wall<br>
To let a beetle pass.<br>
<br>
He glanced with rapid eyes<br>
That hurried all abroad, &mdash;<br>
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;<br>
He stirred his velvet head<br>
<br>
Like one in danger; cautious,<br>
I offered him a crumb,<br>
And he unrolled his feathers<br>
And rowed him softer home<br>
<br>
Than oars divide the ocean,<br>
Too silver for a seam,<br>
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,<br>
Leap, plashless, as they swim.<br>

And then it closes at your feet<br>

He likes a boggy acre,<br>
A floor too cool for corn.<br>
Yet when a child, and barefoot,<br>
I more than once, at morn,<br>
<br>
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash<br>
Unbraiding in the sun, &mdash;<br>
When, stooping to secure it,<br>
It wrinkled, and was gone.<br>

Several of nature's people<br>
I know, and they know me;<br>
I feel for them a transport<br>
Of cordiality;<br>

Without a tighter breathing,<br>

Doth like a bubble antedate,<br>

That very instant passed.<br>
On a strange mob of panting trees,<br>
And fences fled away,<br>
And rivers where the houses ran<br>

No bone had he to bind him,<br>
His speech was like the push<br>
Of numerous humming-birds at once<br>
From a superior bush.<br>

His countenance a billow,<br>
His fingers, if he pass,<br>
Let go a music, as of tunes<br>
Blown tremulous in glass.<br>

Then, like a timid man,<br>

THE JUGGLER OF DAY.<br>

Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,<br>
Leaping like leopards to the sky,<br>
Then at the feet of the old horizon<br>
Laying her spotted face, to die;<br>

Stooping as low as the otter's window,<br>
Touching the roof and tinting the barn,<br>
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow, &mdash;<br>

Farther in summer than the birds,<br>
Pathetic from the grass,<br>
A minor nation celebrates<br>
Its unobtrusive mass.<br>
<br>
No ordinance is seen,<br>
So gradual the grace,<br>
A pensive custom it becomes,<br>
Enlarging loneliness.<br>
<br>
Antiquest felt at noon<br>
When August, burning low,<br>
Calls forth this spectral canticle,<br>
Repose to typify.<br>
<br>
Remit as yet no grace,<br>
No furrow on the glow,<br>
Yet a druidic difference<br>
Enhances nature now.<br>

The summer lapsed away, &mdash;<br>
Too imperceptible, at last,<br>
To seem like perfidy.<br>

A quietness distilled,<br>
As twilight long begun,<br>
Or Nature, spending with herself<br>
Sequestered afternoon.<br>
<br>
The dusk drew earlier in,<br>
The morning foreign shone, &mdash;<br>
A courteous, yet harrowing grace,<br>
As guest who would be gone.<br>
<br>
And thus, without a wing,<br>
Or service of a keel,<br>
Our summer made her light escape<br>
Into the beautiful.<br>

And one, below this morning,<br>

It was a short procession, &mdash;<br>
The bobolink was there,<br>
An aged bee addressed us,<br>
And then we knelt in prayer.<br>

We trust that she was willing, &mdash;<br>
We ask that we may be.<br>
Summer, sister, seraph,<br>
Let us go with thee!<br>

And of the butterfly<br>

There came a purple creature<br>
That ravished all the hill;<br>

The frosts were her condition;<br>

Until the North evoked it.<br>

Gone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,<br>

Sealed are the spicy valves;<br>
Mesmeric fingers softly touch<br>

Unbroken forehead from the east<br>

It reaches to the fence,<br>
It wraps it, rail by rail,<br>
Till it is lost in fleeces;<br>
It flings a crystal veil<br>
<br>
On stump and stack and stem, &mdash;<br>
The summer's empty room,<br>
Acres of seams where harvests were,<br>
Recordless, but for them.<br>
<br>
It ruffles wrists of posts,<br>
As ankles of a queen, &mdash;<br>
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,<br>

The brother of the universe<br>
Was never blown away.<br>

The snow and he are intimate;<br>
I 've often seen them play<br>
When heaven looked upon us all<br>
With such severity,<br>

I felt apology were due<br>
To an insulted sky,<br>
Whose pompous frown was nutriment<br>
To their temerity.<br>

Unfair an immortality<br>

Strange that the feet so precious charged<br>
Should reach so small a goal!<br>

Essential oils are wrung:<br>
The attar from the rose<br>
Is not expressed by suns alone,<br>
It is the gift of screws.<br>

The general rose decays;<br>
But this, in lady's drawer,<br>
Makes summer when the lady lies<br>
In ceaseless rosemary.<br>

I lived on dread; to those who know<br>
The stimulus there is<br>
In danger, other impetus<br>
Is numb and vital-less.<br>

As 't were a spur upon the soul,<br>
A fear will urge it where<br>
To go without the spectre's aid<br>
Were challenging despair.<br>

If I should die,<br>
And you should live,<br>
And time should gurgle on,<br>
And morn should beam,<br>
And noon should burn,<br>
As it has usual done;<br>
If birds should build as early,<br>
And bees as bustling go, &mdash;<br>
One might depart at option<br>
From enterprise below!<br>
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand<br>
When we with daisies lie,<br>
That commerce will continue,<br>
And trades as briskly fly.<br>
It makes the parting tranquil<br>
And keeps the soul serene,<br>
That gentlemen so sprightly<br>
Conduct the pleasing scene!<br>

Her final summer was it,<br>
And yet we guessed it not;<br>
If tenderer industriousness<br>
Pervaded her, we thought<br>
<br>
A further force of life<br>
Developed from within, &mdash;<br>
When Death lit all the shortness up,<br>
And made the hurry plain.<br>
<br>
We wondered at our blindness, &mdash;<br>
When nothing was to see<br>
But her Carrara guide-post, &mdash;<br>
At our stupidity,<br>
<br>
When, duller than our dulness,<br>
The busy darling lay,<br>
So busy was she, finishing,<br>
So leisurely were we!<br>

One need not be a house;<br>
The brain has corridors surpassing<br>
Material place.<br>

Far safer, of a midnight meeting<br>
External ghost,<br>
Than an interior confronting<br>
That whiter host.<br>

Far safer through an Abbey gallop,<br>
The stones achase,<br>
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter<br>
In lonesome place.<br>
<br>
Ourself, behind ourself concealed,<br>
Should startle most;<br>
Assassin, hid in our apartment,<br>
Be horror's least.<br>

The prudent carries a revolver,<br>
He bolts the door,<br>
O'erlooking a superior spectre<br>

It was not frost, for on my flesh<br>
I felt siroccos crawl, &mdash;<br>
Nor fire, for just my marble feet<br>
Could keep a chancel cool.<br>

And yet it tasted like them all;<br>
The figures I have seen<br>
Set orderly, for burial,<br>
Reminded me of mine,<br>

When everything that ticked has stopped,<br>
And space stares, all around,<br>
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,<br>

If I should disappoint the eyes<br>
That hunted, hunted so, to see,<br>
And could not bear to shut until<br>
They "noticed" me &mdash; they noticed me;<br>

So sure I 'd come &mdash; so sure I 'd come,<br>
It listening, listening, went to sleep<br>

<p>PREFACE.</p>

<p>The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that
a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put
forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,
&mdash;even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines.</p>

<p>Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in
letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her
<i>Letters</i>. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in
this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four
exceptionally strong ones, as "A Book," and "With Flowers."</p>

<p>There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward
circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;
for example, the verses "I had a Guinea golden," which seem to
have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in
which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been
written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the
present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
those who apprehend this scintillating spirit.</p>

Because that fearing it so long<br>

There is a fitting a dismay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fitting a despair.<br>
'Tis harder knowing it is due,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than knowing it is here.<br>
The trying on the utmost,<br>

A face devoid of love or grace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hateful, hard, successful face,<br>

I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.<br>
<br>
I had a guinea golden;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lost it in the sand,<br>
And though the sum was simple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pounds were in the land,<br>
Still had it such a value<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto my frugal eye,<br>
That when I could not find it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat me down to sigh.<br>
<br>
I had a crimson robin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sang full many a day,<br>
But when the woods were painted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, too, did fly away.<br>
Time brought me other robins, &mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ballads were the same, &mdash;<br>
Still for my missing troubadour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept the 'house at hame.'<br>
<br>
I had a star in heaven;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Pleiad was its name,<br>
And when I was not heeding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wandered from the same.<br>
And though the skies are crowded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the night ashine,<br>
I do not care about it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since none of them are mine.<br>
<br>
My story has a moral:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a missing friend, &mdash;<br>
Pleiad its name, and robin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guinea in the sand, &mdash;<br>
And when this mournful ditty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accompanied with tear,<br>
Shall meet the eye of traitor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In country far from here,<br>
Grant that repentance solemn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May seize upon his mind,<br>
And he no consolation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the sun may find.<br>

NOTE. &mdash; This poem may have had, like many others, a<br>

GRIEFS.<br>

I measure every grief I meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With analytic eyes;<br>
I wonder if it weighs like mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or has an easier size.<br>
<br>
I wonder if they bore it long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did it just begin?<br>
I could not tell the date of mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels so old a pain.<br>
<br>
I wonder if it hurts to live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if they have to try,<br>
And whether, could they choose between,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would not rather die.<br>
<br>
I wonder if when years have piled &mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some thousands &mdash; on the cause<br>
Of early hurt, if such a lapse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could give them any pause;<br>
<br>
Or would they go on aching still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through centuries above,<br>
Enlightened to a larger pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast with the love.<br>
<br>
The grieved are many, I am told;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason deeper lies, &mdash;<br>
Death is but one and comes but once,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only nails the eyes.<br>
<br>
There's grief of want, and grief of cold, &mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort they call 'despair;'<br>
There's banishment from native eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight of native air.<br>
<br>
And though I may not guess the kind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correctly, yet to me<br>
A piercing comfort it affords<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing Calvary,<br>
<br>
To note the fashions of the cross,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those that stand alone,<br>
Still fascinated to presume<br>

EXPERIENCE.<br>

I stepped from plank to plank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So slow and cautiously;<br>
The stars about my head I felt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About my feet the sea.<br>
<br>
I knew not but the next<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be my final inch, &mdash;<br>
This gave me that precarious gait<br>

<br>
Neither patriarch nor pussy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dissect the play;<br>
Seems it, to my hooded thinking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflex holiday.<br>
<br>
Had there been no sharp subtraction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the early sum,<br>
Not an acre or a caption<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was once a room,<br>

Not a mention, whose small pebble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrinkled any bay, &mdash;<br>
Unto such, were such assembly,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And undermined the years!<br>

I got your letter, and the birds';<br>
The maples never knew<br>
That you were coming, &mdash; I declare,<br>
How red their faces grew!<br>
But, March, forgive me &mdash;<br>
And all those hills<br>
You left for me to hue;<br>
There was no purple suitable,<br>
You took it all with you.<br>

Who knocks? That April!<br>
Lock the door!<br>

Which in a perturbation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature had left behind.<br>
A joyous-going fellow<br>

Which both of benediction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And badinage partook,<br>
Without apparent burden,<br>

He was the faithful father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a dependent brood;<br>
And this untoward transport<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His remedy for care, &mdash;<br>
A contrast to our respites.<br>

It struck me every day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning was as new<br>
As if the cloud that instant slit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the fire through.<br>
<br>
It burned me in the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It blistered in my dream;<br>
It sickened fresh upon my sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every morning's beam.<br>
<br>
I thought that storm was brief, &mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maddest, quickest by;<br>
But Nature lost the date of this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left it in the sky.<br>

Is that great water in the west<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geneva's farthest skill<br>
Can't put the puppet bowing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That just now dangled still.<br>

An awe came on the trinket!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures hunched with pain,<br>
Then quivered out of decimals<br>

<br>
It will not stir for doctors,<br>

The shopman importunes it,<br>

Decades of arrogance between<br>

A long, long sleep, a famous sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes no show for dawn<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An independent one.<br>

RETROSPECT.<br>
<br>
'T was just this time last year I died.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I heard the corn,<br>
When I was carried by the farms, &mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had the tassels on.<br>
<br>
I thought how yellow it would look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard went to mill;<br>
And then I wanted to get out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something held my will.<br>
<br>
I thought just how red apples wedged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stubble's joints between;<br>
And carts went stooping round the fields<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the pumpkins in.<br>
<br>
I wondered which would miss me least,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Thanksgiving came,<br>
If father'd multiply the plates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make an even sum.<br>
<br>
And if my stocking hung too high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it blur the Christmas glee,<br>
That not a Santa Claus could reach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altitude of me?<br>
<br>
But this sort grieved myself, and so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought how it would be<br>
When just this time, some perfect year,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves should come to me.<br>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
