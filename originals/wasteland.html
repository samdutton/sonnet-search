<p id="id00013" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.</p>

<p id="id00014" style="margin-top: 2em">We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.</p>

<p id="id00015">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<p id="id00016" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id00017">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.</p>

<p id="id00018">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.</p>

<p id="id00028" style="margin-top: 2em">***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p id="id00029">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>

<p id="id00030">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p id="id00031">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p id="id00032">LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p id="id00033">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<h5 id="id00034">THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</h5>

<p id="id00035">Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.</p>

<p id="id00036">INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,

     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

<p id="id00049">April is the cruellest month, breeding<br/>

Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br/>

Memory and desire, stirring<br/>

Dull roots with spring rain.<br/>

Winter kept us warm, covering<br/>

Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br/>

A little life with dried tubers.<br/>

Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br/>

With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br/>

And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,                            10<br/>

And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br/>

Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br/>

And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,<br/>

My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,<br/>

And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br/>

Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br/>

In the mountains, there you feel free.<br/>

I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00050">What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br/>

Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,                                  20<br/>

You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br/>

A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br/>

And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br/>

And the dry stone no sound of water. Only<br/>

There is shadow under this red rock,<br/>

(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),<br/>

And I will show you something different from either<br/>

Your shadow at morning striding behind you<br/>

Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;<br/>

I will show you fear in a handful of dust.                              30<br/>

"They called me the hyacinth girl."<br/>

- Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,<br/>

Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not<br/>

Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither<br/>

Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,                                    40<br/>

A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br/>

I had not thought death had undone so many.<br/>

<p id="id00056">The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,<br/>

Glowed on the marble, where the glass<br/>

Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines<br/>

From which a golden Cupidon peeped out                                  80<br/>

(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)<br/>

Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra<br/>

Reflecting light upon the table as<br/>

The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,<br/>

From satin cases poured in rich profusion;<br/>

In vials of ivory and coloured glass<br/>

Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,<br/>

Unguent, powdered, or liquid - troubled, confused<br/>

And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air<br/>

That freshened from the window, these ascended                          90<br/>

In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,<br/>

Flung their smoke into the laquearia,<br/>

Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.<br/>

Huge sea-wood fed with copper<br/>

Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,<br/>

In which sad light a carved dolphin swam.<br/>

Above the antique mantel was displayed<br/>

As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br/>

The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king<br/>

So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale                             100<br/>

Filled all the desert with inviolable voice<br/>

And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br/>

"Jug Jug" to dirty ears.<br/>

And other withered stumps of time<br/>

Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br/>

Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br/>

Footsteps shuffled on the stair.<br/>

Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br/>

Spread out in fiery points<br/>

Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.                        110<br/>

And no more can't I, I said, and think of poor Albert,<br/>

He's been in the army four years, he wants a good time,<br/>

And if you don't give it him, there's others will, I said.<br/>

Oh is there, she said. Something o' that, I said.                       150<br/>

Then I'll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.<br/>

Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,<br/>

Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.<br/>

But at my back in a cold blast I hear<br/>

The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.<br/>

A rat crept softly through the vegetation<br/>

Dragging its slimy belly on the bank<br/>

While I was fishing in the dull canal<br/>

On a winter evening round behind the gashouse                           190<br/>

Musing upon the king my brother's wreck<br/>

And on the king my father's death before him.<br/>

White bodies naked on the low damp ground<br/>

And bones cast in a little low dry garret,<br/>

Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year.<br/>

But at my back from time to time I hear<br/>

The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring<br/>

Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.<br/>

O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter<br/>

Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits<br/>

Like a taxi throbbing waiting,<br/>

At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives                       220<br/>

Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,<br/>

The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,<br/>

Endeavours to engage her in caresses<br/>

Which still are unreproved, if undesired.<br/>

Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;<br/>

Exploring hands encounter no defence;                                   240<br/>

"Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over."<br/>

<p id="id00091">Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the
incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested
by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend:
From Ritual to Romance (Macmillan).&lt;1&gt; Indeed,
so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate
the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do;
and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself)
to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble.
To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has
influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have
used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris.  Anyone who is
acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem
certain references to vegetation ceremonies.</p>

The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack, fits my purpose
in two ways:  because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God
of Frazer, and because I associate him with the hooded figure in
the passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor
and the Merchant appear later; also the "crowds of people," and
Death by Water is executed in Part IV.  The Man with Three Staves
(an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily,
with the Fisher King himself.</p>

<p id="id00130">218.  Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a "character,"
is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest.
Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into
the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct
from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman,
and the two sexes meet in Tiresias.  What Tiresias sees, in fact,
is the substance of the poem.  The whole passage from Ovid is
of great anthropological interest:</p>

exquisite modulation they are unequalled."  Its "water-dripping song"
is justly celebrated.</p>

<p id="id00147">360.  The following lines were stimulated by the account of one
of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one
of Shackleton's): it was related that the party of explorers,
at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion

<p id="id00148">367-77. Cf.  Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos:</p>

<p id="id00149">"Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem
Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang

<p id="id00155">Also F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p.  346:</p>

            Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina."<br/>
