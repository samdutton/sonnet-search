2</span>O MAY I JOIN THE CHOIR INVISIBLE!</h2>
<p>O may I join the choir invisible<br />
Of those immortal dead who live again<br />
In minds made better by their presence; live<br />
In pulses stirred to generosity,<br />
In deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn<br />
Of miserable aims that end with self,<br />
In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,<br />
And with their mild persistence urge men&rsquo;s minds<br />
To vaster issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to live is heaven:<br />
To make undying music in the world,<br />
Breathing a beauteous order that controls<br />
With growing sway the growing life of man.<br />
So we inherit that sweet purity<br />
For which we struggled, failed and agonized<br />
With widening retrospect that bred despair.<br />
Rebellious flesh that would not be subdued,<br />
A vicious parent shaming still its child,<br />
Poor, anxious penitence is quick dissolved;<br />
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
3</span>Its discords, quenched by meeting harmonies,<br />
Die in the large and charitable air;<br />
And all our rarer, better, truer self,<br />
That sobbed religiously in yearning song,<br />
That watched to ease the burden of the world,<br />
Laboriously tracing what must be,<br />
And what may yet be better&mdash;saw rather<br />
A worthier image for the sanctuary<br />
And shaped it forth before the multitude,<br />
Divinely human, raising worship so<br />
To higher reverence more mixed with love&mdash;<br />
That better self shall live till human Time<br />
Shall fold its eyelids, and the human sky<br />
Be gathered like a scroll within the tomb<br />
Unread forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life to come,<br />
Which martyred men have made more glorious<br />
For us who strive to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I reach<br />
That purest heaven&mdash;be to other souls<br />
The cup of strength in some great agony,<br />
Enkindle generous ardor, feed pure love,<br />
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>Beget the smiles that have no cruelty,<br />
Be the sweet presence of a good diffused,<br />
And in diffusion ever more intense!<br />
So shall I join the choir invisible<br />
Whose music is the gladness of the world.</p>

5</span>HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p1.jpg">
<img alt="At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the Sun" 
src="images/p1.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris and he:<br />
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;<br />
&ldquo;Good speed!&rdquo; cried the watch as the gate-bolts 
undrew,<br />
&ldquo;Speed!&rdquo; echoed the wall to us galloping through.<br 
/>
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,<br />
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.</p>
<p>Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace&mdash;<br />
Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;<br />
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<br />
Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,<br />
Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit,<br />
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near<br />
Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;<br />
At Boom a great yellow star came out to see;<br />
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
6</span>At D&uuml;ffeld &rsquo;twas morning as plain as could 
be;<br />
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime&mdash;<br
/>
So Joris broke silence with &ldquo;Yet there is time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun,<br />
And against him the cattle stood black every one,<br />
To stare through the mist at us galloping past;<br />
And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last<br />
With resolute shoulders, each butting away<br />
The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;</p>
<p>And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br />
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track,<br />
And one eye&rsquo;s black intelligence&mdash;ever that glance<br 
/>
O&rsquo;er its white edge at me, his own master, askance;<br />
And the thick heavy spume-flakes, which aye and anon<br />
His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.</p>
<p>By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, &ldquo;Stay 
spur!<br />
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault&rsquo;s not in her;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember at Aix&rdquo;&mdash;for one heard the
quick wheeze<br />
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering 
knees,<br />
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,<br />
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.</p>
<p>So we were left galloping, Joris and I,<br />
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br />
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh;<br />
&rsquo;Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like 
chaff;<br />
Till over by Delhem a dome spire sprung white,<br />
And &ldquo;Gallop,&rdquo; gasped Joris, &ldquo;for Aix is in 
sight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How they&rsquo;ll greet us!&rdquo;&mdash;and all in a 
moment his roan<br />
Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;<br />
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br />
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br />
With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,<br />
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets&rsquo; rim.</p>
<p>Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,<br />
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,<br />
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,<br />
Called my Roland his pet name, my horse without peer&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>Clapped my hands, laughed and sung, any noise, bad or 
good,<br />
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.</p>
<p>And all I remember is friends flocking around,<br />
As I sate with his head twixt my knees on the ground;<br />
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine<br />
As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br />
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)<br />
Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.</p>

9</span>MOTHER AND POET.</h2>
<p>Dead! one of them shot by the sea in the east,<br />
And one of them shot in the west by the sea.<br />
Dead! both my boys!&nbsp; When you sit at the feast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And are wanting a great song for Italy free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let none look at <i>me</i>!</p>
<p>Yet I was a poetess only last year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And good at my art for a woman, men said,<br />
But <i>this</i> woman, <i>this</i>, who is agonized here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forever instead.</p>
<p>What art can woman be good at?&nbsp; Oh, vain!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What art <i>is</i> she good at, but hurting her 
breast<br />
With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, boys, how you hurt! you were strong as you 
pressed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>I</i> proud by that 
test.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>What&rsquo;s art for a woman?&nbsp; To hold on her 
knees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both darlings! to feel all their arms round her 
throat<br />
Cling, strangle a little!&nbsp; To sew by degrees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &rsquo;broider the long clothes and neat little 
coat!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To dream and to dote.</p>
<p>To teach them . . .&nbsp; It stings there.&nbsp; <i>I</i> made
them indeed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak plain the word &lsquo;country.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
taught them, no doubt,<br />
That a country&rsquo;s a thing men should die for at need.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I</i> prated of liberty, rights, and about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tyrant turned out.</p>
<p>And when their eyes flashed, oh, my beautiful eyes!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I exulted! nay, let them go forth at the wheels<br 
/>
Of the guns, and denied not.&nbsp; But then the surprise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When one sits quite alone!&nbsp; Then one weeps, 
then one kneels!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;God! how the house 
feels.</p>
<p>At first happy news came, in gay letters moiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With my kisses, of camp-life and glory, and how<br 
/>
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>They both loved me, and soon, coming home to be 
spoiled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In return would fan off every fly from my brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their green laurel bough.</p>
<p>Then was triumph at Turin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ancona was 
free!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some one came out of the cheers in the 
street,<br />
With a face pale as stone to say something to me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Guido was dead!&nbsp; I fell down at his feet<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they cheered in the 
street.</p>
<p>I bore it&mdash;friends soothed me: my grief looked sublime<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the ransom of Italy.&nbsp; One boy remained<br />
To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first grew immortal, while both of us 
strained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the height he had gained.</p>
<p>And letters still came&mdash;shorter, sadder, more strong,<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Writ now but in one hand.&nbsp; I was not to 
faint,<br />
One loved me for two . . . would be with me ere long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &lsquo;Viva Italia&rsquo; <i>he</i> died for, 
our saint,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who forbids our complaint.</p>

12</span>My Nanni would add, &lsquo;he was safe and aware<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a presence that turned off the balls . . . was 
imprest<br />
It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how &rsquo;twas impossible, quite 
dispossessed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To live on for the 
rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On which, without pause, up the telegraph line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swept smoothly the next news from 
Gaeta&mdash;<i>Shot</i>.<br />
<i>Tell his mother</i>.&nbsp; Ah, ah! &lsquo;his,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;their&rsquo; mother: not &lsquo;mine.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No voice says &lsquo;<i>my</i> mother&rsquo; again 
to me.&nbsp; What!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You think Guido forgot?</p>
<p>Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They drop earth&rsquo;s affection, conceive not of 
woe?<br />
I think not.&nbsp; Themselves were too lately forgiven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through that Love and Sorrow which reconciled so<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Above and Below.</p>
<p>O Christ of the seven wounds, who look&rsquo;dst through the 
dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the face of thy mother! consider, I pray,<br />
How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned 
away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And no last word to say!</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep 
one.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And when Italy&rsquo;s made, for what end is it 
done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have not a son?</p>
<p>Ah! ah! ah! when Gaeta&rsquo;s taken, what then?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the fair, wicked queen sits no more at her 
sport<br />
Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When your guns of Cavalli, with final retort,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have cut the game short&mdash;</p>
<p>When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When your flag takes all Heaven for its white, 
green, and red,<br />
When <i>you</i> have your country from mountain to sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When King Victor has Italy&rsquo;s crown on his 
head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (And I have my dead)</p>
<p>What then?&nbsp; Do not mock me!&nbsp; Ah, ring your bells 
low!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And burn your lights faintly.&nbsp; <i>My</i> 
country is there,<br />
Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>My</i> Italy&rsquo;s there&mdash;with my brave 
civic Pair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To disfranchise despair.</p>

strength,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bite back the cry of their pain in 
self-scorn,<br />
But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into wail such as this! and we sit on forlorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the man-child is born.</p>
<p>Dead! one of them shot by the sea in the west!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of them shot in the east by the sea!<br />

<p>Three years she grew in sun and shower,<br />
Then Nature said, &ldquo;A lovelier flower<br />
On earth was never sown;<br />
This child I to myself will take,<br />
She shall be mine, and I will make<br />
A lady of my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself will to my darling be<br />
Both law and impulse: and with me<br />

In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,<br />

To kindle or restrain.</p>

And hers the silence and the calm,<br />
Of mute insensate things.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
