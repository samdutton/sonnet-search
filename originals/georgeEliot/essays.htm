5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Since the death of George Eliot much public curiosity has been
excited by the repeated allusions to, and quotations from, her
contributions to periodical literature, and a leading newspaper
gives expression to a general wish when it says that &ldquo;this
series of striking essays ought to be collected and reprinted,
both because of substantive worth and because of the light they
throw on the author&rsquo;s literary canons and
predilections.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, the articles which were
published anonymously in <i>The Westminster Review</i> have been
so pointedly designated by the editor, and the biographical
sketch in the &ldquo;Famous Women&rdquo; series is so emphatic in
its praise of them, and so copious in its extracts from one and
the least important one of them, that the publication of all the
Review and magazine articles of the renowned novelist, without
abridgment or alteration, would seem but an act of fair play to
her fame, while at the same time a compliance with a reasonable
public demand.</p>
<p>Nor are these first steps in her wonderful intellectual
progress any the less, but are all the more noteworthy, for being
first steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;To ignore this stage,&rdquo; says the
author of the valuable little volume to which we have just
referred&mdash;&ldquo;to ignore this stage in George
Eliot&rsquo;s mental development would be to lose one of the
connecting links in her history.&rdquo;&nbsp; Furthermore, <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;nothing in her fictions excels the style of these
papers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is all her &ldquo;epigrammatic
felicity,&rdquo; and an irony not surpassed by Heine himself,
while her paper on the poet Young is one of her wittiest bits of
critical analysis.</p>
<p>Her translation of Status&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Jesus&rdquo;
was published in 1840, and her translation of Feuerbach&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Essence of Christianity&rdquo; in 1854.&nbsp; Her
translation of Spinoza&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ethics&rdquo; was finished
the same year, but remains unpublished.&nbsp; She was associate
editor of <i>The Westminster Review</i> from 1851 to 1853.&nbsp;
She was about twenty-seven years of age when her first
translation appeared, thirty-three when the first of these
magazine articles appeared, thirty-eight at the publication of
her first story, and fifty-nine when she finished
&ldquo;Theophrastus Such.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two years after she died,
at the age of sixty-one.&nbsp; So that George Eliot&rsquo;s
literary life covered a period of about thirty-two years.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter on her &ldquo;Analysis of
Motives&rdquo; first appeared as a magazine article, and appears
here at the request of the publishers, after having been
carefully revised, indeed almost entirely rewritten by its
author.</p>
<h2><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;GEORGE ELIOT&rsquo;S&rdquo; ANALYSIS OF
MOTIVES.</h2>
<p>George Eliot is the greatest of the novelists in the
delineation of feeling and the analysis of motives.&nbsp; In
&ldquo;uncovering certain human lots, and seeing how they are
woven and interwoven,&rdquo; some marvellous work has been done
by this master in the two arts of rhetoric and fiction.</p>
<p>If you say the telling of a story is her forte, you put her
below Wilkie Collins or Mrs. Oliphant; if you say her object is
to give a picture of English society, she is surpassed by Bulwer
and Trollope; if she be called a satirist of society, Thackeray
is her superior; if she intends to illustrate the absurdity of
behavior, she is eclipsed by Dickens; but if the analysis of
human motives be her forte and art, she stands first, and it is
very doubtful whether any artist in fiction is entitled to stand
second.&nbsp; She reaches clear in and touches the most secret
and the most delicate spring of human action.&nbsp; She has done
this so well, so apart from the doing of everything else, and so,
in spite of doing some other things indifferently, that she works
on a line quite her own, and quite alone, as a creative artist in
fiction.&nbsp; Others have done this incidentally and
occasionally, as Charlotte Bront&euml; and Walter Scott, but
George Eliot does it elaborately, with laborious painstaking,
with purpose aforethought.&nbsp; Scott said of Richardson:
&ldquo;In his survey of the heart he left neither head, bay, nor
inlet behind him until he had traced its soundings, and laid it
down in his chart with all its minute sinuosities, its depths and
its shallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is too much to say of Richardson, but it is not too much
to say of George Eliot.&nbsp; She has sounded depths and explored
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>sinuosities of the human heart which were utterly unknown
to the author of &ldquo;Clarissa Harlowe.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is like
looking into the translucent brook&mdash;you see the wriggling
tad, the darting minnow, the leisurely trout, the motionless
pike, while in the bays and inlets you see the infusoria and
animalcul&aelig; as well.</p>
<p>George Eliot belongs to and is the greatest of the school of
artists in fiction who write fiction as a means to an end,
instead of as an end.&nbsp; And, while she certainly is not a
story-teller of the first order, considered simply as a
story-teller, her novels are a striking illustration of the power
of fiction as a means to an end.&nbsp; They remind us, as few
other stories do, of the fact that however inferior the story may
be considered simply as a story, it is indispensable to the
delineation of character.&nbsp; No other form of composition, no
discourse, or essay, or series of independent sketches, however
successful, could succeed in bringing out character equal to the
novel.&nbsp; Herein is at once the justification of the power of
fiction.&nbsp; &ldquo;He spake a parable,&rdquo; with an
&ldquo;end&rdquo; in view which could not be so expeditiously
attained by any other form of address.</p>
<p>A story of the first-class, with the story as end in itself,
and a story of the first class told as a means to an end, has
never been, and it is not likely ever will be, found
together.&nbsp; The novel with a purpose is fatal to the novel
written simply to excite by a plot, or divert by pictures of
scenery, or entertain as a mere panorama of social life.&nbsp; So
intense is George Eliot&rsquo;s desire to dissect the human heart
and discover its motives, that plot, diction, situations, and
even consistency in the vocabulary of the characters, are all
made subservient to it.&nbsp; With her it is not so much that the
characters do thus and so, but why they do thus and so.&nbsp;
Dickens portrays the behavior, George Eliot dissects the motive
of the behavior.&nbsp; Here comes the human creature, says
Dickens, now let us see how he will behave.&nbsp; Here comes the
human creature, says George Eliot, now let us see why he
behaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;suppose we turn from
outside estimates <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of a man, to wonder with keener
interest what is the report of his own consciousness about his
doings, with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors,
and with what spirit he wrestles against universal pressure,
which may one day be too heavy for him and bring his heart to a
final pause.&rdquo;&nbsp; The outside estimate is the work of
Dickens and Thackeray, the inside estimate is the work of George
Eliot.</p>
<p>Observe in the opening pages of the great novel of
&ldquo;Middlemarch&rdquo; how soon we pass from the outside dress
to the inside reasons for it, from the costume to the motives
which control it and color it.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;only to close
observers that Celia&rsquo;s dress differed from her
sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and had &ldquo;a shade of coquetry in its
arrangements.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dorothea&rsquo;s &ldquo;plain dressing
was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her sister
shared.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were both influenced by &ldquo;the
pride of being ladies,&rdquo; of belonging to a stock not exactly
aristocratic, but unquestionably &ldquo;good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
very quotation of the word good is significant and
suggestive.&nbsp; There were &ldquo;no parcel-tying
forefathers&rdquo; in the Brooke pedigree.&nbsp; A Puritan
forefather, &ldquo;who served under Cromwell, but afterward
conformed and managed to come out of all political troubles as
the proprietor of a respectable family estate,&rdquo; had a hand
in Dorothea&rsquo;s &ldquo;plain&rdquo; wardrobe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life
involving eternal consequences with a keen interest in gimp and
artificial protrusions of drapery,&rdquo; but Celia &ldquo;had
that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines
without any eccentric agitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both were examples
of &ldquo;reversion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, as an instance of
heredity working itself out in character &ldquo;in Mr. Brooke,
the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance,
but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and
virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could anything be more natural than for a woman with this
passion for, and skill in, &ldquo;unravelling certain human
lots,&rdquo; to lay herself out upon the human lot of woman, with
all her &ldquo;passionate patience of genius?&rdquo;&nbsp; One
would say this was inevitable.&nbsp; And, for a delineation of
what that lot of woman <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>really is, as made for her, there is
nothing in all literature equal to what we find in
&ldquo;Middlemarch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Romola,&rdquo; &ldquo;Daniel
Deronda,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Janet&rsquo;s Repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was a woman, and could not make her own
lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never before, indeed, was so much got out of
the word &ldquo;lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never was that little word so
hard worked, or well worked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We women,&rdquo; says
Gwendolen Harleth, &ldquo;must stay where we grow, or where the
gardeners like to transplant us.&nbsp; We are brought up like the
flowers, to look as pretty as we can, and be dull without
complaining.&nbsp; That is my notion about the plants, and that
is the reason why some of them have got poisonous.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To appreciate the work that George Eliot has done you must read
her with the determination of finding out the reason why
Gwendolen Harleth &ldquo;became poisonous,&rdquo; and Dorothea,
with all her brains and &ldquo;plans,&rdquo; a failure; why
&ldquo;the many Theresas find for themselves no epic life, only a
life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur
ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
must search these marvellous studies in motives for the key to
the blunders of &ldquo;the blundering lives&rdquo; of woman which
&ldquo;some have felt are due to the inconvenient indefiniteness
with which the Supreme power has fashioned the natures of
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as there is not &ldquo;one level of
feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and
no more, the social lot of woman cannot be treated with
scientific certitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is treated with a
dissective delineation in the women of George Eliot unequalled in
the pages of fiction.</p>
<p>And then woman&rsquo;s lot, as respects her &ldquo;social
promotion&rdquo; in matrimony, so much sought, and so necessary
for her to seek, even in spite of her conscience, and at the
expense of her happiness&mdash;the unravelling of that lot would
also come very natural to this expert unraveller.&nbsp; And never
have we had the causes of woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;blunders&rdquo; in
match-making, and man&rsquo;s blunders in love-making, told with
such analytic acumen, or with such pathetic and sarcastic
eloquence.&nbsp; It is not far from the question of woman&rsquo;s
social lot to the question of questions of human life, <!-- page
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the
question which has so tremendous an influence upon the fortunes
of mankind and womankind, the question which it is so easy for
one party to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; and so difficult for the other
party to answer intelligently or sagaciously.</p>
<p>Why does the young man fall in love with the young woman who
is most unfit for him of all the young women of his acquaintance,
and why does the young woman accept the young man, or the old
man, who is better adapted to making her life unendurable than
any other man of her circle of acquaintances?&nbsp; Why does the
stalwart Adam Bede fall in love with Hetty Sorrel, &ldquo;who had
nothing more than her beauty to recommend her?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
delineator of his motives &ldquo;respects him none the
less.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thinks that &ldquo;the deep love he had
for that sweet, rounded, dark-eyed Hetty, of whose inward self he
was really very ignorant, came out of the very strength of his
nature, and not out of any inconsistent weakness.&nbsp; Is it any
weakness, pray, to be wrought upon by exquisite music?&nbsp; To
feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings of
your soul, the delicate fibres of life which no memory can
penetrate, and binding together your whole being, past and
present, in one unspeakable vibration?&nbsp; If not, then neither
is it a weakness to be so wrought upon by the exquisite curves of
a woman&rsquo;s cheek, and neck, and arms; by the liquid depth of
her beseeching eyes, or the sweet girlish pout of her lips.&nbsp;
For the beauty of a lovely woman is like music&mdash;what can one
say more?&rdquo;&nbsp; And so &ldquo;the noblest nature is often
blinded to the character of the woman&rsquo;s soul that beauty
clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence &ldquo;the tragedy of human life is
likely to continue for a long time to come, in spite of mental
philosophers who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding
all mistakes of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How simple the motive of the Rev. Edward Casaubon in popping
the question to Dorothea Brooke, bow complex her motives in
answering the question!&nbsp; He wanted an amanuensis to
&ldquo;love, honor, and obey&rdquo; him.&nbsp; She wanted a
husband who would be &ldquo;a sort of father, and could teach you
even Hebrew if you wished it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The matrimonial
motives are <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>worked to draw out the character of
Dorothea, and nowhere does the method of George Eliot show to
greater advantage than in probing the motives of this fine,
strong, conscientious, blundering young woman, whose voice
&ldquo;was like the voice of a soul that once lived in an
&AElig;olian harp.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had a theoretic cast of
mind.&nbsp; She was &ldquo;enamored of intensity and greatness,
and rash in embracing what seemed to her to have those
aspects.&rdquo;&nbsp; The awful divine had those aspects, and she
embraced him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly such elements in the
character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her
lot, and hinder it from being decided, according to custom, by
good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a George Eliot stroke.&nbsp; If the reader does not
see from that what she is driving at he may as well abandon all
hope of ever appreciating her great forte and art.&nbsp;
Dorothea&rsquo;s goodness and sincerity did not save her from the
worst blunder that a woman can make, while her conscientiousness
only made it inevitable.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all her eagerness to
know the truths of life she retained very childlike ideas about
marriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little of the goose as well as the child
in her conscientious simplicity, perhaps.&nbsp; She &ldquo;felt
sure she would have accepted the judicious Hooker if she had been
born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in
matrimony, or John Milton, when his blindness had come on, or any
other great man whose odd habits it would be glorious piety to
endure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to life, our author furnishes the &ldquo;great
man,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;odd habits,&rdquo; and the miserable
years of &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; endurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dorothea
looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of Mr. Casaubon&rsquo;s
mind, seeing reflected there every quality she herself
brought.&rdquo;&nbsp; They exchanged experiences&mdash;he his
desire to have an amanuensis, and she hers, to be one.&nbsp; He
told her in the billy-cooing of their courtship that &ldquo;his
notes made a formidable range of volumes, but the crowning task
would be to condense these voluminous, still accumulating
results, and bring them, like the earlier vintage of Hippocratic
books, to fit a little shelf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dorothea was
altogether captivated by the <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>wide embrace
of this conception.&nbsp; Here was something beyond the shallows
of ladies&rsquo; school literature.&nbsp; Here was a modern
Augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint.&nbsp;
Dorothea said to herself: &ldquo;His feeling, his experience,
what a lake compared to my little pool!&rdquo;&nbsp; The little
pool runs into the great reservoir.</p>
<p>Will you take this reservoir to be your husband, and will you
promise to be unto him a fetcher of slippers, a dotter of
I&rsquo;s and crosser of T&rsquo;s and a copier and condenser of
manuscripts; until death doth you part?&nbsp; I will.</p>
<p>They spend their honeymoon in Rome, and on page 211 of Vol. I.
we find poor Dorothea &ldquo;alone in her apartments, sobbing
bitterly, with such an abandonment to this relief of an oppressed
heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride will sometimes
allow herself when she feels securely alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
was she crying about?&nbsp; &ldquo;She thought her feeling of
desolation was the fault of her own spiritual
poverty.&rdquo;&nbsp; A characteristic George Eliot probe.&nbsp;
Why does not Dorothea give the real reason for her
desolateness?&nbsp; Because she does not know what the real
reason is&mdash;conscience makes blunderers of us all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How was it that in the weeks since their marriage Dorothea
had not distinctly observed, but felt, with a stifling
depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she
had dreamed of finding in her husband&rsquo;s mind were replaced
by anterooms and winding passages which seemed to lead no
whither?&nbsp; I suppose it was because in courtship everything
is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and the smallest
sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee
delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will
reveal.&nbsp; But, the door-sill of marriage once crossed,
expectation is concentrated on the present.&nbsp; Having once
embarked on your marital voyage, you may become aware that you
make no way, and that the sea is not within sight&mdash;that in
fact you are exploring an inclosed basin.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the
ungauged reservoir turns out to be an inclosed basin, but
Dorothea was prevented by her social lot, and perverse goodness,
and puritanical <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&ldquo;reversion,&rdquo; from
foreseeing that.&nbsp; She might have been saved from her gloomy
marital voyage &ldquo;if she could have fed her affection with
those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman
who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald
doll, creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the
wealth of her own love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, perhaps, Ladislaw
would have been her first husband instead of her second, as he
certainly was her first and only love.&nbsp; Such are the chances
and mischances in the lottery of matrimony.</p>
<p>Equally admirable is the diagnosis of Gwendolen
Harleth&rsquo;s motives in &ldquo;drifting toward the tremendous
decision,&rdquo; and finally landing in it.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
became poor, and I was tempted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marriage came to her
as it comes to many, as a temptation, and like the deadening drug
or the maddening bowl, to keep off the demon of remorse or the
cloud of sorrow, like the forgery or the robbery to save from
want.&nbsp; &ldquo;The brilliant position she had longed for, the
imagined freedom she would create for herself in
marriage&rdquo;&mdash;these &ldquo;had come to her hunger like
food, with the taint of sacrilege upon it,&rdquo; which she
&ldquo;snatched with terror.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grandcourt
&ldquo;fulfilled his side of the bargain by giving her the rank
and luxuries she coveted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Matrimony as a bargain
never had and never will have but one result.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
had a root of conscience in her, and the process of purgatory had
begun for her on earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without the root of
conscience it would have been purgatory all the same.&nbsp; So
much for resorting to marriage for deliverance from poverty or
old maidhood.&nbsp; Better be an old maid than an old fool.&nbsp;
But how are we to be guaranteed against &ldquo;one of those
convulsive motiveless actions by which wretched men and women
leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rosamond Lydgate says, &ldquo;Marriage stays with us like a
murder.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, if she could only have found that out
before instead of after her own marriage!</p>
<p>But &ldquo;what greater thing,&rdquo; exclaims our novelist,
&ldquo;is there for two human souls than to feel that they are
joined for life, to strengthen each other in all labor, to
minister to each other <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>in all pain, to be one with each
other in silent, unspeakable memories at the last
parting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While a large proportion of her work in the analysis of
motives is confined to woman, she has done nothing more skilful
or memorable than the &ldquo;unravelling&rdquo; of
Bulstrode&rsquo;s mental processes by which he &ldquo;explained
the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with
his beliefs.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there were no Dorothea in
&ldquo;Middlemarch&rdquo; the character of Bulstrode would give
that novel a place by itself among the masterpieces of
fiction.&nbsp; The Bulstrode wound was never probed in fiction
with more scientific precision.&nbsp; The pious villain finally
finds himself so near discovery that he becomes
conscientious.&nbsp; &ldquo;His equivocation now turns venomously
upon him with the full-grown fang of a discovered
lie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The past came back to make the present
unendurable.&nbsp; &ldquo;The terror of being judged sharpens the
memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once more &ldquo;he saw himself the
banker&rsquo;s clerk, as clever in figures as he was fluent in
speech, and fond of theological definition.&nbsp; He had striking
experience in conviction and sense of pardon; spoke in
prayer-meeting and on religious platforms.&nbsp; That was the
time he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest of
dream.&nbsp; He remembered his first moments of shrinking.&nbsp;
They were private and were filled with arguments&mdash;some of
these taking the form of prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Private prayer&mdash;but &ldquo;is private prayer necessarily
candid?&nbsp; Does it necessarily go to the roots of
action?&nbsp; Private prayer is inaudible speech, and speech is
representative.&nbsp; Who can represent himself just as he is,
even in his own reflections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bulstrode&rsquo;s course up to the time of his being suspected
&ldquo;had, he thought, been sanctioned by remarkable
providences, appearing to point the way for him to be the agent
in making the best use of a large property.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Providence would have him use for the glory of God the money he
had stolen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could it be for God&rsquo;s service that
this fortune should go to&rdquo; its rightful owners, when its
rightful owners were &ldquo;a young woman and her husband who
were given up to the lightest <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>pursuits, and
might scatter it abroad in triviality&mdash;people who seemed to
lie outside the path of remarkable providences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bulstrode felt at times &ldquo;that his action was
unrighteous, but how could he go back?&nbsp; He had mental
exercises calling himself naught, laid hold on redemption and
went on in his course of instrumentality.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;carrying on two distinct lives&rdquo;&mdash;a religious
one and a wicked one.&nbsp; &ldquo;His religious activity could
not be incompatible with his wicked business as soon as he had
argued himself into not feeling it incompatible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with
him.&nbsp; There may be coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect
beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world, but
Bulstrode was not one of them.&nbsp; He was simply a man whose
desires had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs, and who had
gradually explained the gratification of his desires into
satisfactory agreement with those beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Providence seemed to be taking sides against
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A threatening Providence&mdash;in other words,
a public exposure&mdash;urged him to a kind of propitiation which
was not a doctrinal transaction.&nbsp; The divine tribunal had
changed its aspect to him.&nbsp; Self-prostration was no longer
enough.&nbsp; He must bring restitution in his hand.&nbsp; By
what sacrifice could he stay the rod?&nbsp; He believed that if
he did something right God would stay the rod, and save him from
the consequences of his wrong-doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; His religion
was &ldquo;the religion of personal fear,&rdquo; which
&ldquo;remains nearly at the level of the savage.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The exposure comes, and the explosion.&nbsp; Society shudders
with hypocritical horror, especially in the presence of poor Mrs.
Bulstrode, who &ldquo;should have some hint given her, that if
she knew the truth she would have less complacency in her
bonnet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Society when it is very candid, and very
conscientious, and very scrupulous, cannot &ldquo;allow a wife to
remain ignorant long that the town holds a bad opinion of her
husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; The photograph of the Middlemarch gossips
sitting upon the case of Mrs. Bulstrode is taken
accurately.&nbsp; Equally accurate, and far more impressive, is
the narrative of circumstantial evidence <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>gathering
against the innocent Lydgate and the guilty
Bulstrode&mdash;circumstances that will sometimes weave into one
tableau of public odium the purest and the blackest
characters.&nbsp; From this tableau you may turn to that one in
&ldquo;Adam Bede,&rdquo; and see how circumstances are made to
crush the weak woman and clear the wicked man.&nbsp; And then you
can go to &ldquo;Romola,&rdquo; or indeed to almost any of these
novels, and see how wrong-doing may come of an indulged infirmity
of purpose, that unconscious weakness and conscious wickedness
may bring about the same disastrous results, and that repentance
has no more effect in averting or altering the consequences in
one case than the other.&nbsp; Tito&rsquo;s ruin comes of a
feeble, Felix Holt&rsquo;s victory of an unconquerable,
will.&nbsp; Nothing is more characteristic of George Eliot than
her tracking of Tito through all the motives and counter motives
from which he acted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because he tried to slip away
from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing so
much as his own safety, he came at last to commit such deeds as
make a man infamous.&rdquo;&nbsp; So poor Romola tells her son,
as a warning, and adds: &ldquo;If you make it the rule of your
life to escape from what is disagreeable, calamity may come just
the same, and it would be calamity falling on a base mind, which
is the one form of sorrow that has no balm in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of this passion for the analysis of motives comes the
strong character, slightly gnarled and knotted by natural
circumstances, as trees that are twisted and misshapen by storms
and floods&mdash;or characters gnarled by some interior force
working in conjunction with or in opposition to outward
circumstances.&nbsp; She draws no monstrosities, or monsters,
thus avoiding on the one side romance and on the other
burlesque.&nbsp; She keeps to life&mdash;the life that fails from
&ldquo;the meanness of opportunity,&rdquo; or is &ldquo;dispersed
among hindrances&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrestles&rdquo; unavailingly
&ldquo;with universal pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why had Mr. Gilfil in those late years of his beneficent life
&ldquo;more of the knots and ruggedness of poor human nature than
there lay any clear hint of it in the open-eyed, loving&rdquo;
young <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Maynard?&nbsp; Because &ldquo;it is
with men as with trees: if you lop off their finest branches into
which they were pouring their young life-juice, the wounds will
be healed over with some rough boss, some odd excrescence, and
what might have been a grand tree, expanding into liberal shade,
is but a whimsical, misshapen trunk.&nbsp; Many an irritating
fault, many an unlovely oddity, has come of a hard sorrow which
has crushed and maimed the nature just when it was expanding into
plenteous beauty; and the trivial, erring life, which we visit
with our harsh blame, may be but as the unsteady motion of a man
whose best limb is withered.&nbsp; The dear old Vicar had been
sketched out by nature as a noble tree.&nbsp; The heart of him
was sound, the grain was of the finest, and in the gray-haired
man, with his slipshod talk and caustic tongue, there was the
main trunk of the same brave, faithful, tender nature that had
poured out the finest, freshest forces of its life-current in a
first and only love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her style is influenced by her purpose&mdash;may be said,
indeed, to be created by it.&nbsp; The excellences and the
blemishes of the diction come of the end sought to be attained by
it.&nbsp; Its subtleties and obscurities were equally
inevitable.&nbsp; Analytical thinking takes on an analytical
phraseology.&nbsp; It is a striking instance of a mental habit
creating a vocabulary.&nbsp; The method of thought produces the
form of rhetoric.&nbsp; Some of the sentences are mental
landscapes.&nbsp; The meaning seems to be in motion on the
page.&nbsp; It is elusive from its very subtlety.&nbsp; It is
more our analyst than her character of Rufus Lyon, who
&ldquo;would fain find language subtle enough to follow the
utmost intricacies of the soul&rsquo;s pathways.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Transome&rsquo;s &ldquo;lancet-edged epigrams&rdquo; are
dull in comparison with her own.&nbsp; She uses them with
startling success in dissecting motive and analyzing
feeling.&nbsp; They deserve as great renown as
&ldquo;N&eacute;laton&rsquo;s probe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example: &ldquo;Examine your words well, and you will find
that even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard
thing to say the exact truth, especially about your own
feelings&mdash;<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>much harder than to say something
fine about them which is not the exact truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
ought to make such a revelation of the religious diary-keeper to
himself as to make him ashamed of himself.&nbsp; And this will
fit in here: &ldquo;Our consciences are not of the same pattern,
an inner deliverance of fixed laws&mdash;they are the voice of
sensibilities as various as our memories;&rdquo; and this:
&ldquo;Every strong feeling makes to itself a conscience of its
own&mdash;has its own piety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can say that the joints of his armor are not open to this
thrust?&nbsp; &ldquo;The lapse of time during which a given event
has not happened is in the logic of habit, constantly alleged as
a reason why the event should never happen, even when the lapse
of time is precisely the added condition which makes the event
imminent.&nbsp; A man will tell you that he worked in a mine for
forty years unhurt by an accident as a reason why he should
apprehend no danger, though the roof is beginning to
sink.&rdquo;&nbsp; Silas Marner lost his money through his
&ldquo;sense of security,&rdquo; which &ldquo;more frequently
springs from habit than conviction.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went unrobbed
for fifteen years, which supplied the only needed condition for
his being robbed now.&nbsp; A compensation for stupidity:
&ldquo;If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human
life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the
squirrel&rsquo;s heart beat, and we should die of that roar that
lies on the other side of silence.&nbsp; As it is, the quickest
of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who
does not at once recognize &ldquo;that mixture of pushing forward
and being pushed forward&rdquo; as &ldquo;the brief history of
most human beings?&rdquo;&nbsp; Who has not seen
&ldquo;advancement hindered by impetuous candor?&rdquo; or
&ldquo;private grudges christened by the name of public
zeal?&rdquo; or &ldquo;a church built with an exuberance of faith
and a deficiency of funds?&rdquo; or a man &ldquo;who would march
determinedly along the road he thought best, but who was easily
convinced which was best?&rdquo; or a preacher &ldquo;whose
oratory was like a Belgian railway horn, which shows praiseworthy
intentions inadequately fulfilled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is something chemical about such an analysis as this
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>of Rosamond: &ldquo;Every nerve and muscle was adjusted
to the consciousness that she was being looked at.&nbsp; She was
by nature an actress of parts that entered into her
physique.&nbsp; She even acted her own character, and so well
that she did not know it to be precisely her own!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nor is the exactness of this any less cruel: &ldquo;We may handle
extreme opinions with impunity, while our furniture and our
dinner-giving link us to the established order.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why
not own that &ldquo;the emptiness of all things is never so
striking to us as when we fail in them?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not
better to avoid &ldquo;following great reformers beyond the
threshold of their own homes?&rdquo;&nbsp; Does not &ldquo;our
moral sense learn the manners of good society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lancet works impartially, because the hand that holds it
is the hand of a conscientious artist.&nbsp; She will endure the
severest test you can apply to an artist in fiction.&nbsp; She
does not betray any religious bias in her novels, which is all
the more remarkable now that we find it in these essays.&nbsp;
Nor is it at all remarkable that this bias is so very easily
discovered in the novels by those who have found it in her
essays!&nbsp; Whatever opinions she may have expressed in her
critical reviews, she is not the Evangelical, or the Puritan, or
the Jew, or the Methodist, or the Dissenting Minister, or the
Churchman, any more than she is the Radical, the Liberal, or the
Tory, who talks in the pages of her fiction.</p>
<p>Every side has its say, every prejudice its voice, and every
prejudice and side and vagary even has the philosophical reason
given for it, and the charitable explanation applied to it.&nbsp;
She analyzes the religious motives without obtrusive criticism or
acrid cynicism or nauseous cant&mdash;whether of the orthodox or
heretical form.</p>
<p>The art of fiction has nothing more elevated, or more
touching, or fairer to every variety of religious experience,
than the delineation of the motives that actuated Dinah Morris
the Methodist preacher, Deronda the Jew, Dorothea the Puritan,
Adam and Seth Bede, and Janet Dempster.</p>
<p>Who can object to this?&nbsp; &ldquo;Religious ideas have the
fate of <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>melodies, which, once set afloat in
the world, are taken up by all sorts of instruments, some of them
woefully coarse, feeble, or out of tune, until people are in
danger of crying out that the melody itself is
detestable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not one of the &ldquo;mixed
results of revivals&rdquo; that &ldquo;some gain a religious
vocabulary rather than a religious experience?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is
there a descendant of the Puritans who will not relish the fair
play of this?&nbsp; &ldquo;They might give the name of piety to
much that was only Puritanic egoism; they might call many things
sin that were not sin, but they had at least the feeling that sin
was to be avoided and resisted, and color-blindness, which may
mistake drab for scarlet, is better than total blindness, which
sees no distinction of color at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is not Adam
Bede justified in saying that &ldquo;to hear some preachers
you&rsquo;d think a man must be doing nothing all his life but
shutting his eyes and looking at what&rsquo;s going on in the
inside of him,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;the doctrines are like
finding names for your feelings so that you can talk of them when
you&rsquo;ve never known them?&rdquo;&nbsp; Read all she has said
before you object to anything she has said.&nbsp; Then see
whether you will find fault with her for delineating the motives
of those with whom &ldquo;great illusions&rdquo; are mistaken for
&ldquo;great faith;&rdquo; of those &ldquo;whose celestial
intimacies do not improve their domestic manners,&rdquo; however
&ldquo;holy&rdquo; they may claim to be; of those who
&ldquo;contrive to conciliate the consciousness of filthy rags
with the best damask;&rdquo; of those &ldquo;whose imitative
piety and native worldliness is equally sincere;&rdquo; of those
who &ldquo;think the invisible powers will be soothed by a bland
parenthesis here and there, coming from a man of
property&rdquo;&mdash;parenthetical recognition of the
Almighty!&nbsp; May not &ldquo;religious scruples be like spilled
needles, making one afraid of treading or sitting down, or even
eating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if this is a great mind fascinated with the insoluble
enigma of human motives, it is a mind profoundly in sympathy with
those who are puzzling hopelessly over the riddle or are
struggling hopelessly in its toils.&nbsp; She is &ldquo;on a
level and in the press with them as they struggle their way along
the stony <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>road through the crowd of unloving
fellow-men.&rdquo;&nbsp; She says &ldquo;the only true knowledge
of our fellows is that which enables us to feel with them, which
gives us a finer ear for the heart-pulses that are beating under
the mere clothes of circumstance and opinion.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
artist in fiction ever had a finer ear or a more human sympathy
for the straggler who &ldquo;pushes manfully on&rdquo; and
&ldquo;falls at last,&rdquo; leaving &ldquo;the crowd to close
over the space he has left.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her extraordinary skill
in disclosing &ldquo;the peculiar combination of outward with
inward facts which constitute a man&rsquo;s critical
actions,&rdquo; only makes her the more charitable in judging
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Until we know what this combination has been,
or will be, it will be better not to think ourselves wise
about&rdquo; the character that results.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a
terrible coercion in our deeds which may first turn the honest
man into a deceiver, and then reconcile him to the change.&nbsp;
And for this reason the second wrong presents itself to him in
the guise of the only practicable right.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
nothing of the spirit of &ldquo;served him right,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;just what she deserved,&rdquo; or &ldquo;they ought to
have known better,&rdquo; in George Eliot.&nbsp; That is not in
her line.&nbsp; The opposite of that is exactly in her
line.&nbsp; This is characteristic of her: &ldquo;In this world
there are so many of these common, coarse people, who have no
picturesque or sentimental wretchedness!&nbsp; And it is so
needful we should remember their existence, else we may happen to
leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy, and frame
lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She does not leave them out.&nbsp; Her books are full of them,
and of a Christly charity and plea for them.&nbsp; Who can ever
forget little Tiny, &ldquo;hidden and uncared for as the pulse of
anguish in the breast of the bird that has fluttered down to its
nest with the long-sought food, and has found the nest torn and
empty?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing in fiction to surpass in
pathos the picture of the death of Mrs. Amos Barton.&nbsp; George
Eliot&rsquo;s fellow-feeling comes of the habit she ascribes to
Daniel Deronda, &ldquo;the habit of thinking herself
imaginatively into the experience of others.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is
the reason why her novels come home so pitilessly to those who
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>have had a deep experience of human life.&nbsp; These
are the men and women whom she fascinates and alienates.&nbsp; I
know strong men and brave women who are afraid of her books, and
say so.&nbsp; It is because of her realness, her unrelenting
fidelity to human nature and human life.&nbsp; It is because the
analysis is so delicate, subtle, and far-in.&nbsp; Hence the
atmosphere of sadness that pervades her pages.&nbsp; It was
unavoidable.&nbsp; To see only the behavior, as Dickens did,
amuses us; to study only the motive at the root of the behavior,
as George Eliot does, saddens us.&nbsp; The humor of Mrs. Poyser
and the wit of Mrs. Transome only deepen the pathos by relieving
it.&nbsp; There is hardly a sarcasm in these books but has its
pensive undertone.</p>
<p>It is all in the key of &ldquo;Ye Banks and Braes o&rsquo;
Bonnie Doon,&rdquo; and that would be an appropriate key for a
requiem over the grave of George Eliot.</p>
<p>All her writings are now before the world, and are accessible
to all.&nbsp; They have taken their place, and will keep their
place, high among the writings of those of our age who have made
that age illustrious in the history of the English tongue.</p>

25</span>THE ESSAYS OF &ldquo;GEORGE ELIOT.&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; CARLYLE&rsquo;S LIFE OF STERLING.</h3>
<p>As soon as the closing of the Great Exhibition afforded a
reasonable hope that there would once more be a reading public,
&ldquo;The Life of Sterling&rdquo; appeared.&nbsp; A new work by
Carlyle must always be among the literary births eagerly
chronicled by the journals and greeted by the public.&nbsp; In a
book of such parentage we care less about the subject than about
its treatment, just as we think the &ldquo;Portrait of a
Lord&rdquo; worth studying if it come from the pencil of a
Vandyck.&nbsp; The life of John Sterling, however, has intrinsic
interest, even if it be viewed simply as the struggle of a
restless aspiring soul, yearning to leave a distinct impress of
itself on the spiritual development of humanity, with that fell
disease which, with a refinement of torture, heightens the
susceptibility and activity of the faculties, while it undermines
their creative force.&nbsp; Sterling, moreover, was a man
thoroughly in earnest, to whom poetry and philosophy were not
merely another form of paper currency or a ladder to fame, but an
end in themselves&mdash;one of those finer spirits with whom,
amid the jar and hubbub of our daily life,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
melodies abide<br />
Of the everlasting chime.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>But his intellect was active and rapid, rather than
powerful, and in all his writings we feel the want of a stronger
electric current to give that vigor of conception and felicity of
expression, by which we distinguish the undefinable something
called genius; while his moral nature, though refined and
elevated, seems to have been subordinate to his intellectual
tendencies and social qualities, and to have had itself little
determining influence on his life.&nbsp; His career was less
exceptional than his character: a youth marked by delicate health
and studious tastes, a short-lived and not very successful share
in the management of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, a fever of
sympathy with Spanish patriots, arrested before it reached a
dangerous crisis by an early love affair ending in marriage, a
fifteen months&rsquo; residence in the West Indies, eight months
of curate&rsquo;s duty at Herstmonceux, relinquished on the
ground of failing health, and through his remaining years a
succession of migrations to the South in search of a friendly
climate, with the occasional publication of an
&ldquo;article,&rdquo; a tale, or a poem in <i>Blackwood</i> or
elsewhere&mdash;this, on the prosaic background of an easy
competence, was what made up the outer tissue of Sterling&rsquo;s
existence.&nbsp; The impression of his intellectual power on his
personal friends seems to have been produced chiefly by the
eloquence and brilliancy of his conversation; but the mere reader
of his works and letters would augur from them neither the wit
nor the <i>curiosa felicitas</i> of epithet and imagery, which
would rank him with the men whose sayings are thought worthy of
perpetuation in books of table-talk and &ldquo;ana.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The public, then, since it is content to do without biographies
of much more remarkable men, cannot be supposed to have felt any
pressing demand even for a single life of Sterling; still less,
it might be thought, when so distinguished a writer as Archdeacon
Hare had furnished this, could there be any need for
another.&nbsp; But, in opposition to the majority of Mr.
Carlyle&rsquo;s critics, we agree with him that the first life is
properly the justification of the second.&nbsp; Even among the
readers personally unacquainted with Sterling, those who
sympathized with his <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>ultimate alienation from the Church,
rather than with his transient conformity, were likely to be
dissatisfied with the entirely apologetic tone of Hare&rsquo;s
life, which, indeed, is confessedly an incomplete presentation of
Sterling&rsquo;s mental course after his opinions diverged from
those of his clerical biographer; while those attached friends
(and Sterling possessed the happy magic that secures many such)
who knew him best during this latter part of his career, would
naturally be pained to have it represented, though only by
implication, as a sort of deepening declension ending in a
virtual retraction.&nbsp; Of such friends Carlyle was the most
eminent, and perhaps the most highly valued, and, as co-trustee
with Archdeacon Hare of Sterling&rsquo;s literary character and
writings, he felt a kind of responsibility that no mistaken idea
of his departed friend should remain before the world without
correction.&nbsp; Evidently, however, his &ldquo;Life of
Sterling&rdquo; was not so much the conscientious discharge of a
trust as a labor of love, and to this is owing its strong
charm.&nbsp; Carlyle here shows us his &ldquo;sunny
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; We no longer see him breathing out
threatenings and slaughter as in the Latter-Day Pamphlets, but
moving among the charities and amenities of life, loving and
beloved&mdash;a Teufelsdr&ouml;ckh still, but humanized by a
Blumine worthy of him.&nbsp; We have often wished that genius
would incline itself more frequently to the task of the
biographer&mdash;that when some great or good personage dies,
instead of the dreary three or five volumed compilations of
letter, and diary, and detail, little to the purpose, which two
thirds of the reading public have not the chance, nor the other
third the inclination, to read, we could have a real
&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; setting forth briefly and vividly the
man&rsquo;s inward and outward struggles, aims, and achievements,
so as to make clear the meaning which his experience has for his
fellows.&nbsp; A few such lives (chiefly, indeed,
autobiographies) the world possesses, and they have, perhaps,
been more influential on the formation of character than any
other kind of reading.&nbsp; But the conditions required for the
perfection of life writing&mdash;personal intimacy, a loving and
poetic nature which sees the <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>beauty and
the depth of familiar things, and the artistic power which seizes
characteristic points and renders them with lifelike
effect&mdash;are seldom found in combination.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Life of Sterling&rdquo; is an instance of this rare
conjunction.&nbsp; Its comparatively tame scenes and incidents
gather picturesqueness and interest under the rich lights of
Carlyle&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; We are told neither too little nor
too much; the facts noted, the letters selected, are all such as
serve to give the liveliest conception of what Sterling was and
what he did; and though the book speaks much of other persons,
this collateral matter is all a kind of scene-painting, and is
accessory to the main purpose.&nbsp; The portrait of Coleridge,
for example, is precisely adapted to bring before us the
intellectual region in which Sterling lived for some time before
entering the Church.&nbsp; Almost every review has extracted this
admirable description, in which genial veneration and compassion
struggle with irresistible satire; but the emphasis of quotation
cannot be too often given to the following pregnant
paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The truth is, I now see Coleridge&rsquo;s
talk and speculation was the emblem of himself.&nbsp; In it, as
in him, a ray of heavenly inspiration struggled, in a tragically
ineffectual degree, with the weakness of flesh and blood.&nbsp;
He says once, he &lsquo;had skirted the howling deserts of
infidelity.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was evident enough; but he had not
had the courage, in defiance of pain and terror, to press
resolutely across said deserts to the new firm lands of faith
beyond; he preferred to create logical <i>fata-morganas</i> for
himself on this hither side, and laboriously solace himself with
these.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above mentioned step of Sterling&mdash;his entering the
Church&mdash;is the point on which Carlyle is most decidedly at
issue with Archdeacon Hare.&nbsp; The latter holds that had
Sterling&rsquo;s health permitted him to remain in the Church, he
would have escaped those aberrations from orthodoxy, which, in
the clerical view, are to be regarded as the failure and
shipwreck of his career, apparently thinking, like that friend of
Arnold&rsquo;s who recommended a curacy as the best means of
clearing up Trinitarian difficulties, that &ldquo;orders&rdquo;
are a sort of spiritual <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>backboard, which, by dint of obliging
a man to look as if he were strait, end by making him so.&nbsp;
According to Carlyle, on the contrary, the real
&ldquo;aberration&rdquo; of Sterling was his choice of the
clerical profession, which was simply a mistake as to his true
vocation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sterling,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was not
intrinsically, nor had ever been in the highest or chief degree,
a devotional mind.&nbsp; Of course all excellence in man, and
worship as the supreme excellence, was part of the inheritance of
this gifted man; but if called to define him, I should say
artist, not saint, was the real bent of his being.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No man of Sterling&rsquo;s veracity, had he
clearly consulted his own heart, or had his own heart been
capable of clearly responding, and not been bewildered by
transient fantasies and theosophic moonshine, could have
undertaken this function.&nbsp; His heart would have answered,
&lsquo;No, thou canst not.&nbsp; What is incredible to thee, thou
shalt not, at thy soul&rsquo;s peril, attempt to believe!&nbsp;
Elsewhither for a refuge, or die here.&nbsp; Go to perdition if
thou must, but not with a lie in thy mouth; by the eternal Maker,
no!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the period when Carlyle&rsquo;s own acquaintance with
Sterling commenced, the Life has a double interest, from the
glimpses it gives us of the writer, as well as of his hero.&nbsp;
We are made present at their first introduction to each other; we
get a lively idea of their colloquies and walks together, and in
this easy way, without any heavy disquisition or narrative, we
obtain a clear insight into Sterling&rsquo;s character and mental
progress.&nbsp; Above all, we are gladdened with a perception of
the affinity that exists between noble souls, in spite of
diversity in ideas&mdash;in what Carlyle calls &ldquo;the logical
outcome&rdquo; of the faculties.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Life of
Sterling&rdquo; is a touching monument of the capability human
nature possesses of the highest love, the love of the good and
beautiful in character, which is, after all, the essence of
piety.&nbsp; The style of the work, too, is for the most part at
once pure and rich; there are passages of deep pathos which come
upon the reader like a strain of solemn music, and <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>others which show that aptness of epithet, that masterly
power of close delineation, in which, perhaps, no writer has
excelled Carlyle.</p>
<p>We have said that we think this second &ldquo;Life of
Sterling&rdquo; justified by the first; but were it not so, the
book would justify itself.</p>

31</span>II.&nbsp; WOMAN IN FRANCE: MADAME DE SABL&Eacute;. <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></h3>
<p>In 1847, a certain Count Leopold Ferri died at Padua, leaving
a library entirely composed of works written by women, in various
languages, and this library amounted to nearly 32,000
volumes.&nbsp; We will not hazard any conjecture as to the
proportion of these volumes which a severe judge, like the priest
in Don Quixote, would deliver to the flames, but for our own
part, most of these we should care to rescue would be the works
of French women.&nbsp; With a few remarkable exceptions, our own
feminine literature is made up of books which could have been
better written by men&mdash;books which have the same relation to
literature is general, as academic prize poems have to poetry:
when not a feeble imitation, they are usually an absurd
exaggeration of the masculine style, like the swaggering gait of
a bad actress in male attire.&nbsp; Few English women have
written so much like a woman as Richardson&rsquo;s Lady G.&nbsp;
Now we think it an immense mistake to maintain that there is no
sex in literature.&nbsp; Science has no sex: the mere knowing and
reasoning faculties, if they act correctly, must go through the
same process, and arrive at the same result.&nbsp; But in art and
literature, which imply the action of the entire being, in which
every fibre of the nature is engaged, in which every peculiar
modification of the individual makes itself felt, woman has
something specific to contribute.&nbsp; Under every imaginable
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>social condition, she will necessarily have a class of
sensations and emotions&mdash;the maternal ones&mdash;which must
remain unknown to man; and the fact of her comparative physical
weakness, which, however it may have been exaggerated by a
vicious civilization, can never be cancelled, introduces a
distinctively feminine condition into the wondrous chemistry of
the affections and sentiments, which inevitably gives rise to
distinctive forms and combinations.&nbsp; A certain amount of
psychological difference between man and woman necessarily arises
out of the difference of sex, and instead of being destined to
vanish before a complete development of woman&rsquo;s
intellectual and moral nature, will be a permanent source of
variety and beauty as long as the tender light and dewy freshness
of morning affect us differently from the strength and brilliancy
of the midday sun.&nbsp; And those delightful women of France,
who from the beginning of the seventeenth to the close of the
eighteenth century, formed some of the brightest threads in the
web of political and literary history, wrote under circumstances
which left the feminine character of their minds uncramped by
timidity, and unstrained by mistaken effort.&nbsp; They were not
trying to make a career for themselves; they thought little, in
many cases not at all, of the public; they wrote letters to their
lovers and friends, memoirs of their every-day lives, romances in
which they gave portraits of their familiar acquaintances, and
described the tragedy or comedy which was going on before their
eyes.&nbsp; Always refined and graceful, often witty, sometimes
judicious, they wrote what they saw, thought, and felt in their
habitual language, without proposing any model to themselves,
without any intention to prove that women could write as well as
men, without affecting manly views or suppressing womanly
ones.&nbsp; One may say, at least with regard to the women of the
seventeenth century, that their writings were but a charming
accident of their more charming lives, like the petals which the
wind shakes from the rose in its bloom.&nbsp; And it is but a
twin fact with this, that in France alone woman has had a vital
influence on the development <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of
literature; in France alone the mind of woman has passed like an
electric current through the language, making crisp and definite
what is elsewhere heavy and blurred; in France alone, if the
writings of women were swept away, a serious gap would be made in
the national history.</p>
<p>Patriotic gallantry may perhaps contend that English women
could, if they had liked, have written as well as their
neighbors; but we will leave the consideration of that question
to the reviewers of the literature that might have been.&nbsp; In
the literature that actually is, we must turn to France for the
highest examples of womanly achievement in almost every
department.&nbsp; We confess ourselves unacquainted with the
productions of those awful women of Italy, who held professorial
chairs, and were great in civil and canon law; we have made no
researches into the catacombs of female literature, but we think
we may safely conclude that they would yield no rivals to that
which is still unburied; and here, we suppose, the question of
pre-eminence can only lie between England and France.&nbsp; And
to this day, Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; remains the single
instance of a woman who is supreme in a class of literature which
has engaged the ambition of men; Madame Dacier still reigns the
queen of blue stockings, though women have long studied Greek
without shame; <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> Madame de Sta&euml;l&rsquo;s name still
rises first to the lips when we are asked to mention a woman of
great intellectual power; Madame Roland is still the unrivalled
type of the sagacious and sternly heroic, yet lovable woman;
George Sand is the unapproached artist who, to Jean
Jacques&rsquo; eloquence and deep sense of external nature,
unites the clear delineation of character and the tragic depth of
passion.&nbsp; These great names, which mark different epochs,
soar like tall pines amidst a forest of less conspicuous, but not
less fascinating, female writers; and beneath these, again, are
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>spread, like a thicket of hawthorns, eglantines, and
honey-suckles, the women who are known rather by what they
stimulated men to write, than by what they wrote
themselves&mdash;the women whose tact, wit, and personal radiance
created the atmosphere of the <i>Salon</i>, where literature,
philosophy, and science, emancipated from the trammels of
pedantry and technicality, entered on a brighter stage of
existence.</p>
<p>What were the causes of this earlier development and more
abundant manifestation of womanly intellect in France?&nbsp; The
primary one, perhaps, lies in the physiological characteristics
of the Gallic race&mdash;the small brain and vivacious
temperament which permit the fragile system of woman to sustain
the superlative activity requisite for intellectual creativeness;
while, on the other hand, the larger brain and slower temperament
of the English and Germans are, in the womanly organization,
generally dreamy and passive.&nbsp; The type of humanity in the
latter may be grander, but it requires a larger sum of conditions
to produce a perfect specimen.&nbsp; Throughout the animal world,
the higher the organization, the more frequent is the departure
from the normal form; we do not often see imperfectly developed
or ill-made insects, but we rarely see a perfectly developed,
well-made man.&nbsp; And thus the <i>physique</i> of a woman may
suffice as the substratum for a superior Gallic mind, but is too
thin a soil for a superior Teutonic one.&nbsp; Our theory is
borne out by the fact that among our own country-women those who
distinguish themselves by literary production more frequently
approach the Gallic than the Teutonic type; they are intense and
rapid rather than comprehensive.&nbsp; The woman of large
capacity can seldom rise beyond the absorption of ideas; her
physical conditions refuse to support the energy required for
spontaneous activity; the voltaic-pile is not strong enough to
produce crystallizations; phantasms of great ideas float through
her mind, but she has not the spell which will arrest them, and
give them fixity.&nbsp; This, more than unfavorable external
circumstances, is, we think, the reason why woman has not yet
contributed any new form to art, any discovery in <!-- page
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>science, any deep-searching inquiry in philosophy.&nbsp;
The necessary physiological conditions are not present in
her.&nbsp; That under more favorable circumstances in the future,
these conditions may prove compatible with the feminine
organization, it would be rash to deny.&nbsp; For the present, we
are only concerned with our theory so far as it presents a
physiological basis for the intellectual effectiveness of French
women.</p>
<p>A secondary cause was probably the laxity of opinion and
practice with regard to the marriage-tie.&nbsp; Heaven forbid
that we should enter on a defence of French morals, most of all
in relation to marriage!&nbsp; But it is undeniable that unions
formed in the maturity of thought and feeling, and grounded only
on inherent fitness and mutual attraction, tended to bring women
into more intelligent sympathy with men, and to heighten and
complicate their share in the political drama.&nbsp; The
quiescence and security of the conjugal relation are doubtless
favorable to the manifestation of the highest qualities by
persons who have already attained a high standard of culture, but
rarely foster a passion sufficient to rouse all the faculties to
aid in winning or retaining its beloved object&mdash;to convert
indolence into activity, indifference into ardent partisanship,
dulness into perspicuity.&nbsp; Gallantry and intrigue are sorry
enough things in themselves, but they certainly serve better to
arouse the dormant faculties of woman than embroidery and
domestic drudgery, especially when, as in the high society of
France in the seventeenth century, they are refined by the
influence of Spanish chivalry, and controlled by the spirit of
Italian causticity.&nbsp; The dreamy and fantastic girl was
awakened to reality by the experience of wifehood and maternity,
and became capable of loving, not a mere phantom of her own
imagination, but a living man, struggling with the hatreds and
rivalries of the political arena; she espoused his quarrels, she
made herself, her fortune, and her influence, the stepping-stones
of his ambition; and the languid beauty, who had formerly seemed
ready to &ldquo;die of a rose,&rdquo; was seen to become the
heroine of an insurrection.&nbsp; The vivid interest in affairs
which was thus excited in woman <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>must
obviously have tended to quicken her intellect, and give it a
practical application; and the very sorrows&mdash;the heart-pangs
and regrets which are inseparable from a life of
passion&mdash;deepened her nature by the questioning of self and
destiny which they occasioned, and by the energy demanded to
surmount them and live on.&nbsp; No wise person, we imagine,
wishes to restore the social condition of France in the
seventeenth century, or considers the ideal programme of
woman&rsquo;s life to be a <i>marriage de convenance</i> at
fifteen, a career of gallantry from twenty to eight-and-thirty,
and penitence and piety for the rest of her days.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, that social condition has its good results, as much
as the madly superstitious Crusades had theirs.</p>
<p>But the most indisputable source of feminine culture and
development in France was the influence of the <i>salons</i>,
which, as all the world knows, were <i>r&eacute;unions</i> of
both sexes, where conversation ran along the whole gamut of
subjects, from the frothiest <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>
to the philosophy of Descartes.&nbsp; Richelieu had set the
fashion of uniting a taste for letters with the habits of polite
society and the pursuits of ambition; and in the first quarter of
the seventeenth century there were already several h&ocirc;tels
in Paris, varying in social position from the closest proximity
of the Court to the debatable ground of the aristocracy and the
bourgeoisie, which served as a rendezvous for different circles
of people, bent on entertaining themselves either by showing
talent or admiring it.&nbsp; The most celebrated of these
rendezvous was the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, which was at the
culmination of its glory in 1630, and did not become quite
extinct until 1648, when the troubles of the Fronde commencing,
its <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> were dispersed or absorbed by
political interests.&nbsp; The presiding genius of this
<i>salon</i>, the Marquise de Rambouillet, was the very model of
the woman who can act as anamalgam to the most incongruous
elements; beautiful, but not preoccupied by coquetry, or passion;
an enthusiastic admirer of talent, but with no pretensions to
talent on her own part; exquisitely refined in language and
manners, <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>but warm and generous withal; not
given to entertain her guests with her own compositions, or to
paralyze them by her universal knowledge.&nbsp; She had once
<i>meant</i> to learn Latin, but had been prevented by an
illness; perhaps she was all the better acquainted with Italian
and Spanish productions, which, in default of a national
literature, were then the intellectual pabulum of all cultivated
persons in France who are unable to read the classics.&nbsp; In
her mild, agreeable presence was accomplished that blending of
the high-toned chivalry of Spain with the caustic wit and refined
irony of Italy, which issued in the creation of a new standard of
taste&mdash;the combination of the utmost exaltation in sentiment
with the utmost simplicity of language.&nbsp; Women are
peculiarly fitted to further such a combination&mdash;first, from
their greater tendency to mingle affection and imagination with
passion, and thus subtilize it into sentiment; and next, from
that dread of what overtaxes their intellectual energies, either
by difficulty, or monotony, which gives them an instinctive
fondness for lightness of treatment and airiness of expression,
thus making them cut short all prolixity and reject all
heaviness.&nbsp; When these womanly characteristics were brought
into conversational contact with the materials furnished by such
minds as those of Richelieu, Corneille, the Great Cond&eacute;,
Balzac, and Bossuet, it is no wonder that the result was
something piquant and charming.&nbsp; Those famous
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet did not,
apparently, first lay themselves out to entertain the ladies with
grimacing &ldquo;small-talk,&rdquo; and then take each other by
the sword-knot to discuss matters of real interest in a corner;
they rather sought to present their best ideas in the guise most
acceptable to intelligent and accomplished women.&nbsp; And the
conversation was not of literature only: war, politics, religion,
the lightest details of daily news&mdash;everything was
admissible, if only it were treated with refinement and
intelligence.&nbsp; The H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet was no mere
literary <i>r&eacute;union</i>; it included <i>hommes
d&rsquo;affaires</i> and soldiers as well as authors, and in such
a circle women would not become <i>bas bleus</i> or dreamy <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>moralizers, ignorant of the world and of human nature,
but intelligent observers of character and events.&nbsp; It is
easy to understand, however, that with the herd of imitators who,
in Paris and the provinces, aped the style of this famous
<i>salon</i>, simplicity degenerated into affectation, and
nobility of sentiment was replaced by an inflated effort to
outstrip nature, so that the <i>genre pr&eacute;cieux</i> drew
down the satire, which reached its climax in the
<i>Pr&eacute;cieuses Ridicules</i> and <i>Les Femmes
Savantes</i>, the former of which appeared in 1660, and the
latter in 1673.&nbsp; But Madelon and Caltros are the lineal
descendants of Mademoiselle Scudery and her satellites, quite as
much as of the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet.&nbsp; The society
which assembled every Saturday in her <i>salon</i> was
exclusively literary, and although occasionally visited by a few
persons of high birth, bourgeois in its tone, and enamored of
madrigals, sonnets, stanzas, and <i>bouts rim&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp;
The affectation that decks trivial things in fine language
belongs essentially to a class which sees another above it, and
is uneasy in the sense of its inferiority; and this affectation
is precisely the opposite of the original <i>genre
pr&eacute;cieux</i>.</p>
<p>Another centre from which feminine influence radiated into the
national literature was the Palais du Luxembourg, where
Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Orleans, in disgrace at court on account of
her share in the Fronde, held a little court of her own, and for
want of anything else to employ her active spirit busied herself
with literature.&nbsp; One fine morning it occurred to this
princess to ask all the persons who frequented her court, among
whom were Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, Madame de la Fayette,
and La Rochefoucauld, to write their own portraits, and she at
once set the example.&nbsp; It was understood that defects and
virtues were to be spoken of with like candor.&nbsp; The idea was
carried out; those who were not clever or bold enough to write
for themselves employing the pen of a friend.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; says M. Cousin, &ldquo;was the
pastime of Mademoiselle and her friends during the years 1657 and
1658: from this pastime proceeded a complete literature.&nbsp; In
1659 S&eacute;grais revised these portraits, added a considerable
number in prose and even in verse, and <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>published the
whole in a handsome quarto volume, admirably printed, and now
become very rare, under the title, &lsquo;Divers
Portraits.&rsquo;&nbsp; Only thirty copies were printed, not for
sale, but to be given as presents by Mademoiselle.&nbsp; The work
had a prodigious success.&nbsp; That which had made the fortune
of Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ry&rsquo;s romances&mdash;the
pleasure of seeing one&rsquo;s portrait a little flattered,
curiosity to see that of others, the passion which the middle
class always have had and will have for knowing what goes on in
the aristocratic world (at that time not very easy of access),
the names of the illustrious persons who were here for the first
time described physically and morally with the utmost detail,
great ladies transformed all at once into writers, and
unconsciously inventing a new manner of writing, of which no book
gave the slightest idea, and which was the ordinary manner of
speaking of the aristocracy; this undefinable mixture of the
natural, the easy, and at the same time of the agreeable, and
supremely distinguished&mdash;all this charmed the court and the
town, and very early in the year 1659 permission was asked of
Mademoiselle to give a new edition of the privileged book for the
use of the public in general.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fashion thus set, portraits multiplied throughout France,
until in 1688 La Bruy&egrave;re adopted the form in his
&ldquo;Characters,&rdquo; and ennobled it by divesting it of
personality.&nbsp; We shall presently see that a still greater
work than La Bruy&egrave;re&rsquo;s also owed its suggestion to a
woman, whose salon was hardly a less fascinating resort than the
H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet itself.</p>
<p>In proportion as the literature of a country is enriched and
culture becomes more generally diffused, personal influence is
less effective in the formation of taste and in the furtherance
of social advancement.&nbsp; It is no longer the coterie which
acts on literature, but literature which acts on the coterie; the
circle represented by the word <i>public</i> is ever widening,
and ambition, poising itself in order to hit a more distant mark,
neglects the successes of the salon.&nbsp; What was once lavished
prodigally in conversation is reserved for the volume or the
&ldquo;article,&rdquo; and the effort is not to betray
originality rather than to communicate it.&nbsp; As the old
coach-roads have sunk into disuse through the creation of
railways, so journalism tends more and more to divert information
from the channel of conversation into the <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>channel of
the Press; no one is satisfied with a more circumscribed audience
than that very indeterminate abstraction &ldquo;the
public,&rdquo; and men find a vent for their opinions not in
talk, but in &ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp; We read the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> askance at the tea-table, and take notes
from the <i>Philosophical Journal</i> at a soir&eacute;e; we
invite our friends that we may thrust a book into their hands,
and presuppose an exclusive desire in the &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; to
discuss their own matters, &ldquo;that we may crackle the
<i>Times</i>&rdquo; at our ease.&nbsp; In fact, the evident
tendency of things to contract personal communication within the
narrowest limits makes us tremble lest some further development
of the electric telegraph should reduce us to a society of mutes,
or to a sort of insects communicating by ingenious antenna of our
own invention.&nbsp; Things were far from having reached this
pass in the last century; but even then literature and society
had outgrown the nursing of coteries, and although many
<i>salons</i> of that period were worthy successors of the
H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, they were simply a recreation, not an
influence.&nbsp; Enviable evenings, no doubt, were passed in
them; and if we could be carried back to any of them at will, we
should hardly know whether to choose the Wednesday dinner at
Madame Geoffrin&rsquo;s, with d&rsquo;Alembert, Mademoiselle de
l&rsquo;Espinasse, Grimm, and the rest, or the graver society
which, thirty years later, gathered round Condorcet and his
lovely young wife.&nbsp; The <i>salon</i> retained its
attractions, but its power was gone: the stream of life had
become too broad and deep for such small rills to affect it.</p>
<p>A fair comparison between the French women of the seventeenth
century and those of the eighteenth would, perhaps, have a
balanced result, though it is common to be a partisan on this
subject.&nbsp; The former have more exaltation, perhaps more
nobility of sentiment, and less consciousness in their
intellectual activity&mdash;less of the <i>femme auteur</i>,
which was Rousseau&rsquo;s horror in Madame d&rsquo;Epinay; but
the latter have a richer fund of ideas&mdash;not more ingenuity,
but the materials of an additional century for their ingenuity to
work upon.&nbsp; The women of the seventeenth century, when love
was on the wane, took to <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>devotion, at
first mildly and by halves, as English women take to caps, and
finally without compromise; with the women of the eighteenth
century, Bossuet and Massillon had given way to Voltaire and
Rousseau; and when youth and beauty failed, then they were thrown
on their own moral strength.</p>
<p>M. Cousin is especially enamored of the women of the
seventeenth century, and relieves himself from his labors in
philosophy by making researches into the original documents which
throw light upon their lives.&nbsp; Last year he gave us some
results of these researches in a volume on the youth of the
Duchess de Longueville; and he has just followed it up with a
second volume, in which he further illustrates her career by
tracing it in connection with that of her friend, Madame de
Sabl&eacute;.&nbsp; The materials to which he has had recourse
for this purpose are chiefly two celebrated collections of
manuscript: that of Conrart, the first secretary to the French
Academy, one of those universally curious people who seem made
for the annoyance of contemporaries and the benefit of posterity;
and that of Valant, who was at once the physician, the secretary,
and general steward of Madame de Sabl&eacute;, and who, with or
without her permission, possessed himself of the letters
addressed to her by her numerous correspondents during the latter
part of her life, and of various papers having some personal or
literary interest attached to them.&nbsp; From these stores M.
Cousin has selected many documents previously unedited; and
though he often leaves us something to desire in the arrangement
of his materials, this volume of his on Madame de Sabl&eacute; is
very acceptable to us, for she interests us quite enough to carry
us through more than three hundred pages of rather scattered
narrative, and through an appendix of correspondence in small
type.&nbsp; M. Cousin justly appreciates her character as
&ldquo;un heureux m&eacute;lange de raison, d&rsquo;esprit,
d&rsquo;agr&eacute;ment, et de bont&eacute;;&rdquo; and perhaps
there are few better specimens of the woman who is extreme in
nothing but sympathetic in all things; who affects us by no
special quality, but by her entire being; whose nature has no
<i>tons criards</i>, but is like those textures which, <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>from
their harmonious blending of all colors, give repose to the eye,
and do not weary us though we see them every day.&nbsp; Madame de
Sabl&eacute; is also a striking example of the one order of
influence which woman has exercised over literature in France;
and on this ground, as well as intrinsically, she is worth
studying.&nbsp; If the reader agrees with us he will perhaps be
inclined, as we are, to dwell a little on the chief points in her
life and character.</p>
<p>Madeline de Souvr&eacute;, daughter of the Marquis of
Courtenvaux, a nobleman distinguished enough to be chosen as
governor of Louis XIII., was born in 1599, on the threshold of
that seventeenth century, the brilliant genius of which is mildly
reflected in her mind and history.&nbsp; Thus, when in 1635 her
more celebrated friend, Mademoiselle de Bourbon, afterward the
Duchess de Longueville, made her appearance at the H&ocirc;tel de
Rambouillet, Madame de Sabl&eacute; had nearly crossed that
tableland of maturity which precedes a woman&rsquo;s descent
toward old age.&nbsp; She had been married in 1614, to Philippe
Emanuel de Laval-Montmorency, Seigneur de Bois-Dauphin, and
Marquis de Sabl&eacute;, of whom nothing further is known than
that he died in 1640, leaving her the richer by four children,
but with a fortune considerably embarrassed.&nbsp; With beauty
and high rank added to the mental attractions of which we have
abundant evidence, we may well believe that Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s youth was brilliant.&nbsp; For her beauty,
we have the testimony of sober Madame de Motteville, who also
speaks of her as having &ldquo;beaucoup de lumi&egrave;re et de
sinc&eacute;rit&eacute;;&rdquo; and in the following passage very
graphically indicates one phase of Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s
character:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Marquise de Sabl&eacute; was one of
those whose beauty made the most noise when the Queen came into
France.&nbsp; But if she was amiable, she was still more desirous
of appearing so; this lady&rsquo;s self-love rendered her too
sensitive to the regard which men exhibited toward her.&nbsp;
There yet existed in France some remains of the politeness which
Catherine de Medici had introduced from Italy, and the new
dramas, with all the other works in prose and verse, which <!--
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>came from Madrid, were thought to have such great
delicacy, that she (Madame de Sabl&eacute;) had conceived a high
idea of the gallantry which the Spaniards had learned from the
Moors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was persuaded that men can, without crime, have
tender sentiments for women&mdash;that the desire of pleasing
them led men to the greatest and finest actions&mdash;roused
their intelligence, and inspired them with liberality, and all
sorts of virtues; but, on the other hand, women, who were the
ornament of the world, and made to be served and adored, ought
not to admit anything from them but their respectful
attentions.&nbsp; As this lady supported her views with much
talent and great beauty, she had given them authority in her
time, and the number and consideration of those who continued to
associate with her have caused to subsist in our day what the
Spaniards call <i>finezas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the grand element of the original <i>femme
pr&eacute;cieuse</i>, and it appears farther, in a detail also
reported by Madame de Motteville, that Madame de Sabl&eacute; had
a passionate admirer in the accomplished Duc de Montmorency, and
apparently reciprocated his regard; but discovering (at what
period of their attachment is unknown) that he was raising a
lover&rsquo;s eyes toward the queen, she broke with him at
once.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard her say,&rdquo; tells Madame de
Motteville, &ldquo;that her pride was such with regard to the Duc
de Montmorency, that at the first demonstrations which he gave of
his change, she refused to see him any more, being unable to
receive with satisfaction attentions which she had to share with
the greatest princess in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no
evidence except the untrustworthy assertion of Tallement de
R&eacute;aux, that Madame de Sabl&eacute; had any other
<i>liaison</i> than this; and the probability of the negative is
increased by the ardor of her friendships.&nbsp; The strongest of
these was formed early in life with Mademoiselle Dona
d&rsquo;Attichy, afterward Comtesse de Maure; it survived the
effervescence of youth, and the closest intimacy of middle age,
and was only terminated by the death of the latter in 1663.&nbsp;
A little incident in this friendship is so characteristic in the
transcendentalism which was then carried into all the affections,
that it is worth relating at length.&nbsp; Mademoiselle
d&rsquo;Attichy, in her grief and indignation at
Richelieu&rsquo;s treatment of her relative, <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>quitted
Paris, and was about to join her friend at Sabl&eacute;, when she
suddenly discovered that Madame de Sabl&eacute;, in a letter to
Madame de Rambouillet, had said that her greatest happiness would
be to pass her life with Julie de Rambouillet, afterward Madame
de Montausier.&nbsp; To Anne d&rsquo;Attichy this appears nothing
less than the crime of <i>l&egrave;se-amiti&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; No
explanations will appease her: she refuses to accept the
assurance that the offensive expression was used simply out of
unreflecting conformity to the style of the H&ocirc;tel de
Rambouillet&mdash;that it was mere
&ldquo;<i>galimatias</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gives up her journey,
and writes a letter, which is the only one Madame de Sabl&eacute;
chose to preserve, when, in her period of devotion, she
sacrificed the records of her youth.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have seen this letter in which you tell
me there is so much <i>galimatias</i>, and I assure you that I
have not found any at all.&nbsp; On the contrary, I find
everything very plainly expressed, and among others, one which is
too explicit for my satisfaction&mdash;namely, what you have said
to Madame de Rambouillet, that if you tried to imagine a
perfectly happy life for yourself, it would be to pass it all
alone with Mademoiselle de Rambouillet.&nbsp; You know whether
any one can be more persuaded than I am of her merit; but I
confess to you that that has not prevented me from being
surprised that you could entertain a thought which did so great
an injury to our friendship.&nbsp; As to believing that you said
this to one, and wrote it to the other, simply for the sake of
paying them an agreeable compliment, I have too high an esteem
for your courage to be able to imagine that complaisance would
cause you thus to betray the sentiments of your heart, especially
on a subject in which, as they were unfavorable to me, I think
you would have the more reason for concealing them, the affection
which I have for you being so well known to every one, and
especially to Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, so that I doubt
whether she will not have been more sensible of the wrong you
have done me, than of the advantage you have given her.&nbsp; The
circumstance of this letter falling into my hands has forcibly
reminded me of these lines of Bertaut:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Malheureuse est l&rsquo;ignorance<br />
Et plus malheureux le savoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having through this lost a confidence which alone
rendered life supportable to me, it is impossible for me to take
the journey so <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>much thought of.&nbsp; For would
there be any propriety in travelling sixty miles in this season,
in order to burden you with a person so little suited to you,
that after years of a passion without parallel, you cannot help
thinking that the greatest pleasure of your life would be to pass
it without her?&nbsp; I return, then, into my solitude, to
examine the defects which cause me so much unhappiness, and
unless I can correct them, I should have less joy than confusion
in seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It speaks strongly for the charm of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s nature that she was able to retain so
susceptible a friend as Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Attichy in spite of
numerous other friendships, some of which, especially that with
Madame de Longueville, were far from lukewarm&mdash;in spite too
of a tendency in herself to distrust the affection of others
toward her, and to wait for advances rather than to make
them.&nbsp; We find many traces of this tendency in the
affectionate remonstrances addressed to her by Madame de
Longueville, now for shutting herself up from her friends, now
for doubting that her letters are acceptable.&nbsp; Here is a
little passage from one of these remonstrances which indicates a
trait of Madame de Sabl&eacute;, and is in itself a bit of
excellent sense, worthy the consideration of lovers and friends
in general: &ldquo;I am very much afraid that if I leave to you
the care of letting me know when I can see you, I shall be a long
time without having that pleasure, and that nothing will incline
you to procure it me, for I have always observed a certain
lukewarmness in your friendship after our <i>explanations</i>,
from which I have never seen you thoroughly recover; and that is
why I dread explanations, for however good they may be in
themselves, since they serve to reconcile people, it must always
be admitted, to their shame, that they are at least the effect of
a bad cause, and that if they remove it for a time they
<i>sometimes leave a certain facility in getting angry again</i>,
which, without diminishing friendship, renders its intercourse
less agreeable.&nbsp; It seems to me that I find all this in your
behavior to me; so I am not wrong in sending to know if you wish
to have me to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is clear that Madame de
Sabl&eacute; was far <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>from having what Sainte-Beuve calls
the one fault of Madame Necker&mdash;absolute perfection.&nbsp; A
certain exquisiteness in her physical and moral nature was, as we
shall see, the source of more than one weakness, but the
perception of these weaknesses, which is indicated in Madame de
Longueville&rsquo;s letters, heightens our idea of the attractive
qualities which notwithstanding drew from her, at the sober age
of forty, such expressions as these: &ldquo;I assure you that you
are the person in all the world whom it would be most agreeable
to me to see, and there is no one whose intercourse is a ground
of truer satisfaction to me.&nbsp; It is admirable that at all
times, and amidst all changes, the taste for your society remains
in me; and, <i>if one ought to thank God for the joys which do
not tend to salvation</i>, I should thank him with all my heart
for having preserved that to me at a time in which he has taken
away from me all others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since we have entered on the chapter of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s weaknesses, this is the place to mention
what was the subject of endless raillery from her
friends&mdash;her elaborate precaution about her health, and her
dread of infection, even from diseases the least
communicable.&nbsp; Perhaps this anxiety was founded as much on
&aelig;sthetic as on physical grounds, on disgust at the details
of illness as much as on dread of suffering: with a cold in the
head or a bilious complaint, the exquisite
<i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i> must have been considerably less
conscious of being &ldquo;the ornament of the world,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;made to be adored.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even her friendship,
strong as it was, was not strong enough to overcome her horror of
contagion; for when Mademoiselle de Bourbon, recently become
Madame de Longueville, was attacked by small-pox, Madame de
Sabl&eacute; for some time had not courage to visit her, or even
to see Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, who was assiduous in her
attendance on the patient.&nbsp; A little correspondence
<i>&agrave; propos</i> of these circumstances so well exhibits
the graceful badinage in which the great ladies of that day were
adepts, that we are attempted to quote one short letter.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;<i>Mlle. de Rambouillet to the Marquise de
Sabl&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mlle, de Chalais (<i>dame de compagnie</i> to the
Marquise) will please to read this letter to Mme. la Marquise,
<i>out of</i> a draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, I do not think it possible to begin my treaty
with you too early, for I am convinced that between the first
proposition made to me that I should see you, and the conclusion,
you will have so many reflections to make, so many physicians to
consult, and so many fears to surmount, that I shall have full
leisure to air myself.&nbsp; The conditions which I offer to
fulfil for this purpose are, not to visit you until I have been
three days absent from the H&ocirc;tel de Cond&eacute; (where
Mme. de Longueville was ill), to choose a frosty day, not to
approach you within four paces, not to sit down on more than one
seat.&nbsp; You may also have a great fire in your room, burn
juniper in the four corners, surround yourself with imperial
vinegar, with rue and wormwood.&nbsp; If you can feel yourself
safe under these conditions, without my cutting off my hair, I
swear to you to execute them religiously; and if you want
examples to fortify you, I can tell you that the Queen consented
to see M. Chaudebonne, when he had come directly from Mme. de
Bourbon&rsquo;s room, and that Mme. d&rsquo;Aiguillon, who has
good taste in such matters, and is free from reproach on these
points, has just sent me word that if I did not go to see her she
would come to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madame de Sabl&eacute; betrays in her reply that she winces
under this raillery, and thus provokes a rather severe though
polite rejoinder, which, added to the fact that Madame de
Longueville is convalescent, rouses her courage to the pitch of
paying the formidable visit.&nbsp; Mademoiselle de Rambouillet,
made aware through their mutual friend Voiture, that her sarcasm
has cut rather too deep, winds up the matter by writing that very
difficult production a perfectly conciliatory yet dignified
apology.&nbsp; Peculiarities like this always deepen with age,
and accordingly, fifteen years later, we find Madame
D&rsquo;Orleans in her &ldquo;Princesse de
Paphlagonia&rdquo;&mdash;a romance in which she describes her
court, with the little quarrels and other affairs that agitated
it&mdash;giving the following amusing picture, or rather
caricature, of the extent to which Madame de Sabl&eacute; carried
her pathological mania, which seems to have been shared by her
friend the Countess de Maure (Mademoiselle <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>d&rsquo;Attichy).&nbsp; In the romance, these two ladies
appear under the names of Princesse Parth&eacute;nie and the
Reine de Mionie.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was not an hour in the day in which
they did not confer together on the means of avoiding death, and
on the art of rendering themselves immortal.&nbsp; Their
conferences did not take place like those of other people; the
fear of breathing an air which was too cold or top warm, the
dread lest the wind should be too dry or too moist&mdash;in
short, the imagination that the weather might not be as temperate
as they thought necessary for the preservation of their health,
caused them to write letters from one room to the other.&nbsp; It
would be extremely fortunate if these notes could be found, and
formed into a collection.&nbsp; I am convinced that they would
contain rules for the regimen of life, precautions even as to the
proper time for applying remedies, and also remedies which
Hippocrates and Galen, with all their science, never heard
of.&nbsp; Such a collection would be very useful to the public,
and would be highly profitable to the faculties of Paris and
Montpellier.&nbsp; If these letters were discovered, great
advantages of all kinds might be derived from them, for they were
princesses who had nothing mortal about them but the
<i>knowledge</i> that they were mortal.&nbsp; In their writings
might be learned all politeness in style, and the most delicate
manner of speaking on all subjects.&nbsp; There is nothing with
which they were not acquainted; they knew the affairs of all the
States in the world, through the share they had in all the
intrigues of its private members, either in matters of gallantry,
as in other things, on which their advice was necessary; either
to adjust embroilments and quarrels, or to excite them, for the
sake of the advantages which their friends could derive from
them;&mdash;in a word, they were persons through whose hands the
secrets of the whole world had to pass.&nbsp; The Princess
Parth&eacute;nie (Mme. de Sabl&eacute;) had a palate as delicate
as her mind; nothing could equal the magnificence of the
entertainments she gave; all the dishes were exquisite, and her
cleanliness was beyond all that could be imagined.&nbsp; It was
in their time that writing came into use; previously nothing was
written but marriage contracts, and letters were never heard of;
thus it is to them that we owe a practice so convenient in
intercourse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still later in 1669, when the most uncompromising of the Port
Royalists seemed to tax Madame de Sabl&eacute; with lukewarmness
that she did not join them at Port-Royal-des-Champs, we find her
writing to the stern M. de S&eacute;vigny: &ldquo;En
v&eacute;rit&eacute;, je <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>crois que je
ne pourrois mieux faire que de tout quitter et de m&rsquo;en
aller l&agrave;.&nbsp; Mais que deviendroient ces frayeurs de
n&rsquo;avoir pas de m&eacute;dicines &agrave; choisir, ni de
chirurgien pour me saigner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, as we have seen, hints at the love of delicate
eating, which many of Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s friends
numbered among her foibles, especially after her religious career
had commenced.&nbsp; She had a genius in<i> friandise</i>, and
knew how to gratify the palate without offending the highest
sense of refinement.&nbsp; Her sympathetic nature showed itself
in this as in other things; she was always sending <i>bonnes
bouches</i> to her friends, and trying to communicate to them her
science and taste in the affairs of the table.&nbsp; Madame de
Longueville, who had not the luxurious tendencies of her friend,
writes: &ldquo;Je vous demande au nom de Dieu, que vous ne me
pr&eacute;pariez aucun rago&ucirc;t.&nbsp; Surtout ne me donnez
point de festin.&nbsp; Au nom de Dieu, qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait
rien que ce qu&rsquo;on peut manger, car vous savez que
c&rsquo;est inutile pour moi; de plus j&rsquo;en ai
scrupule.&rdquo;&nbsp; But other friends had more appreciation of
her niceties.&nbsp; Voiture thanks her for her melons, and
assures her that they are better than those of yesterday; Madame
de Choisy hopes that her ridicule of Jansenism will not provoke
Madame de Sabl&eacute; to refuse her the receipt for salad; and
La Rochefoucauld writes: &ldquo;You cannot do me a greater
charity than to permit the bearer of this letter to enter into
the mysteries of your marmalade and your genuine preserves, and I
humbly entreat you to do everything you can in his favor.&nbsp;
If I could hope for two dishes of those preserves, which I did
not deserve to eat before, I should be indebted to you all my
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; For our own part, being as far as possible
from fraternizing with those spiritual people who convert a
deficiency into a principle, and pique themselves on an obtuse
palate as a point of superiority, we are not inclined to number
Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s <i>friandise</i> among her
defects.&nbsp; M. Cousin, too, is apologetic on this point.&nbsp;
He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was only the excess of a delicacy which
can be really understood, and a sort of fidelity to the character
of <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>.&nbsp; As the <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>
did nothing according to common usage, she could not dine <!--
page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>like another.&nbsp; We have cited a passage from Mme. de
Motteville, where Mme. de Sabl&eacute; is represented in her
first youth at the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, maintaining that
woman is born to be an ornament to the world, and to receive the
adoration of men.&nbsp; The woman worthy of the name ought always
to appear above material wants, and retain, even in the most
vulgar details of life, something distinguished and
purified.&nbsp; Eating is a very necessary operation, but one
which is not agreeable to the eye.&nbsp; Mme. de Sabl&eacute;
insisted on its being conducted with a peculiar
cleanliness.&nbsp; According to her it was not every woman who
could with impunity be at table in the presence of a lover; the
first distortion of the face, she said, would be enough to spoil
all.&nbsp; Gross meals made for the body merely ought to be
abandoned to <i>bourgeoises</i>, and the refined woman should
appear to take a little nourishment merely to sustain her, and
even to divert her, as one takes refreshments and ices.&nbsp;
Wealth did not suffice for this: a particular talent was
required.&nbsp; Mme. de Sabl&eacute; was a mistress in this
art.&nbsp; She had transported the aristocratic spirit, and the
<i>genre pr&eacute;cieux</i>, good breeding and good taste, even
into cookery.&nbsp; Her dinners, without any opulence, were
celebrated and sought after.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite in accordance with all this that Madame de
Sabl&eacute; should delight in fine scents, and we find that she
did; for being threatened, in her Port Royal days, when she was
at an advanced age, with the loss of smell, and writing for
sympathy and information to M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s, who had
lost that sense early in life, she receives this admonition from
the stern saint: &ldquo;You would gain by this loss, my very dear
sister, if you made use of it as a satisfaction to God, for
having had too much pleasure in delicious scents.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scarron describes her as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La non pareille Bois-Dauphine,<br />
<i>Entre dames perle tr&egrave;s fine</i>,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the superlative delicacy implied by this epithet seems to
have belonged equally to her personal habits, her affections, and
her intellect.</p>
<p>Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s life, for anything we know,
flowed on evenly enough until 1640, when the death of her husband
threw upon her the care of an embarrassed fortune.&nbsp; She
found a friend in R&eacute;n&eacute; de Longueil, Seigneur de
Maisons, of whom we are content to know no more than that he
helped <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Madame de Sabl&eacute; to arrange her
affairs, though only by means of alienating from her family the
estate of Sabl&eacute;, that his house was her refuge during the
blockade of Paris in 1649, and that she was not unmindful of her
obligations to him, when, subsequently, her credit could be
serviceable to him at court.&nbsp; In the midst of these
pecuniary troubles came a more terrible trial&mdash;the loss of
her favorite son, the brave and handsome Guy de Laval, who, after
a brilliant career in the campaigns of Cond&eacute;, was killed
at the siege of Dunkirk, in 1646, when scarcely
four-and-twenty.&nbsp; The fine qualities of this young man had
endeared him to the whole army, and especially to Cond&eacute;,
had won him the hand of the Chancellor S&eacute;guire&rsquo;s
daughter, and had thus opened to him the prospect of the highest
honors.&nbsp; His loss seems to have been the most real sorrow of
Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Soon after followed
the commotions of the Fronde, which put a stop to social
intercourse, and threw the closest friends into opposite
ranks.&nbsp; According to Lenet, who relies on the authority of
Gourville, Madame de Sabl&eacute; was under strong obligations to
the court, being in the receipt of a pension of 2000 crowns; at
all events, she adhered throughout to the Queen and Mazarin, but
being as far as possible from a fierce partisan, and given both
by disposition and judgment to hear both sides of the question,
she acted as a conciliator, and retained her friends of both
parties.&nbsp; The Countess de Maure, whose husband was the most
obstinate of <i>frondeurs</i>, remained throughout her most
cherished friend, and she kept up a constant correspondence with
the lovely and intrepid heroine of the Fronde, Madame de
Longueville.&nbsp; Her activity was directed to the extinction of
animosities, by bringing about marriages between the Montagues
and Capulets of the Fronde&mdash;between the Prince de
Cond&eacute;, or his brother, and the niece of Mazarin, or
between the three nieces of Mazarin and the sons of three
noblemen who were distinguished leaders of the Fronde.&nbsp;
Though her projects were not realized, her conciliatory position
enabled her to preserve all her friendships intact, and when the
political <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>tempest was over, she could assemble
around her in her residence, in the Place Royal, the same society
as before.&nbsp; Madame de Sabl&eacute; was now approaching her
twelfth <i>lustrum</i>, and though the charms of her mind and
character made her more sought after than most younger women, it
is not surprising that, sharing as she did in the religious ideas
of her time, the concerns of &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; seemed to
become pressing.&nbsp; A religious retirement, which did not
exclude the reception of literary friends or the care for
personal comforts, made the most becoming frame for age and
diminished fortune.&nbsp; Jansenism was then to ordinary
Catholicism what Puseyism is to ordinary Church of Englandism in
these days&mdash;it was a <i>r&eacute;cherch&eacute;</i> form of
piety unshared by the vulgar; and one sees at once that it must
have special attractions for the <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>.&nbsp;
Madame de Sabl&eacute;, then, probably about 1655 or &rsquo;56,
determined to retire to Port Royal, not because she was already
devout, but because she hoped to become so; as, however, she
wished to retain the pleasure of intercourse with friends who
were still worldly, she built for herself a set of apartments at
once distinct from the monastery and attached to it.&nbsp; Here,
with a comfortable establishment, consisting of her secretary,
Dr. Valant, Mademoiselle de Chalais, formerly her <i>dame de
compagnie</i>, and now become her friend; an excellent cook; a
few other servants, and for a considerable time a carriage and
coachman; with her best friends within a moderate distance, she
could, as M. Cousin says, be out of the noise of the world
without altogether forsaking it, preserve her dearest
friendships, and have before her eyes edifying
examples&mdash;&ldquo;vaquer enfin &agrave; son aise aux soins de
son salut et &agrave; ceux de sa sant&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have hitherto looked only at one phase of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s character and influence&mdash;that of the
<i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>.&nbsp; But she was much more than this:
she was the valuable, trusted friend of noble women and
distinguished men; she was the animating spirit of a society,
whence issued a new form of French literature; she was the woman
of large capacity and large heart, whom Pascal sought to please,
to whom Arnauld submitted <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the Discourse
prefixed to his &ldquo;Logic,&rdquo; and to whom La Rochefoucauld
writes: &ldquo;Vous savez que je ne crois que vous &ecirc;tes sur
de certains chapitres, et surtout sur les replis da
c&oelig;ur.&rdquo;&nbsp; The papers preserved by her secretary,
Valant, show that she maintained an extensive correspondence with
persons of various rank and character; that her pen was untiring
in the interest of others; that men made her the depositary of
their thoughts, women of their sorrows; that her friends were as
impatient, when she secluded herself, as if they had been rival
lovers and she a youthful beauty.&nbsp; It is into her ear that
Madame de Longueville pours her troubles and difficulties, and
that Madame de la Fayette communicates her little alarms, lest
young Count de St. Paul should have detected her intimacy with La
Rochefoucauld. <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a>&nbsp; The few of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s letters which survive show that she excelled
in that epistolary style which was the specialty of the
H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet: one to Madame de Montausier, in favor
of M. P&eacute;rier, the brother-in-law of Pascal, is a happy
mixture of good taste and good sense; but among them all we
prefer quoting one to the Duchess de la Tremouille.&nbsp; It is
light and pretty, and made out of almost nothing, like soap,
bubbles.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Je croix qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a que moi

il est vrai qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a personne que j&rsquo;honore

je vous fais de ne me laisser plus endurcir en mes fautes et de
demeurer inviolablement, Madame, votre, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was not the woman, who could unite the ease and grace
indicated by this letter, with an intellect that men thought
worth consulting on matters of reasoning and philosophy, with
warm affections, untiring activity for others, no ambition as an
authoress, and an insight into <i>confitures</i> and
<i>rago&ucirc;ts</i>, a rare combination?&nbsp; No wonder that
her <i>salon</i> at Port Royal was the favorite resort of such
women as Madame de la Fayette, Madame de Montausier, Madame de
Longueville, and Madame de Hautefort; and of such men as Pascal,
La Rochefoucauld, Nicole, and Domat.&nbsp; The collections of
Valant contain papers which show what were the habitual subjects
of conversation in this salon.&nbsp; Theology, of course, was a
chief topic; but physics and metaphysics had their turn, and
still more frequently morals, taken in their widest sense.&nbsp;
There were &ldquo;Conferences on Calvinism,&rdquo; of which an
abstract is preserved.&nbsp; When Rohault invented his glass
tubes to serve for the barometrical experiments in which Pascal
had roused a strong interest, the Marquis de Sourdis entertained
the society with a paper entitled &ldquo;Why Water Mounts in a
Glass Tube.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cartesianism was an exciting topic here,
as well as everywhere else in France; it had its partisans and
opponents, and papers were read containing &ldquo;Thoughts on the
Opinions of M. Descartes.&rdquo;&nbsp; These lofty matters were
varied by discussions on love and friendship, on the drama, and
on most of the things in heaven and earth which the philosophy of
that day <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>dreamt of.&nbsp;
Morals&mdash;generalizations on human affections, sentiments, and
conduct&mdash;seem to have been the favorite theme; and the aim
was to reduce these generalizations to their briefest form of
expression, to give them the epigrammatic turn which made them
portable in the memory.&nbsp; This was the specialty of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s circle, and was, probably, due to her own
tendency.&nbsp; As the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet was the nursery
of graceful letter-writing, and the Luxembourg of
&ldquo;portraits&rdquo; and &ldquo;characters,&rdquo; so Madame
de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s <i>salon</i> fostered that taste for the
sententious style, to which we owe, probably, some of the best
<i>Pens&eacute;es</i> of Pascal, and certainly, the
&ldquo;Maxims&rdquo; of La Rochefoucauld.&nbsp; Madame de
Sabl&eacute; herself wrote maxims, which were circulated among
her friends; and, after her death, were published by the
Abb&eacute; d&rsquo;Ailly.&nbsp; They have the excellent sense
and nobility of feeling which we should expect in everything of
hers; but they have no stamp of genius or individual character:
they are, to the &ldquo;Maxims&rdquo; of La Rochefoucauld, what
the vase moulded in dull, heavy clay is to the vase which the
action of fire has made light, brittle, and transparent.&nbsp;
She also wrote a treatise on Education, which is much praised by
La Rochefoucauld and M. d&rsquo;Andilly; but which seems no
longer to be found: probably it was not much more elaborate than
her so-called &ldquo;Treatise on Friendship,&rdquo; which is but
a short string of maxims.&nbsp; Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s
forte was evidently not to write herself, but to stimulate others
to write; to show that sympathy and appreciation which are as
genial and encouraging as the morning sunbeams.&nbsp; She
seconded a man&rsquo;s wit with understanding&mdash;one of the
best offices which womanly intellect has rendered to the
advancement of culture; and the absence of originality made her
all the more receptive toward the originality of others.</p>
<p>The manuscripts of Pascal show that many of the
<i>Pens&eacute;es</i>, which are commonly supposed to be raw
materials for a great work on religion, were remodelled again and
again, in order to bring them to the highest degree of terseness
and finish, which <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>would hardly have been the case if
they had only been part of a quarry for a greater
production.&nbsp; Thoughts, which are merely collected as
materials, as stones out of which a building is to be erected,
are not cut into facets, and polished like amethysts or
emeralds.&nbsp; Since Pascal was from the first in the habit of
visiting Madame de Sabl&eacute;, at Port Royal, with his sister,
Madame P&eacute;rier (who was one of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s dearest friends), we may well suppose that
he would throw some of his jewels among the large and small coin
of maxims, which were a sort of subscription money there.&nbsp;
Many of them have an epigrammatical piquancy, which was just the
thing to charm a circle of vivacious and intelligent women: they
seem to come from a La Rochefoucauld who has been dipped over
again in philosophy and wit, and received a new layer.&nbsp; But
whether or not Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s influence served to
enrich the <i>Pens&eacute;es</i> of Pascal, it is clear that but
for her influence the &ldquo;Maxims&rdquo; of La Rochefoucauld
would never have existed.&nbsp; Just as in some circles the
effort is, who shall make the best puns (<i>horibile dictu</i>!),
or the best charades, in the <i>salon</i> of Port Royal the
amusement was to fabricate maxims.&nbsp; La Rochefoucauld said,
&ldquo;L&rsquo;envie de faire des maximes se gagne comme la
rhume.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far from claiming for himself the
initiation of this form of writing, he accuses Jacques Esprit,
another <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of Madame de Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s
<i>salon</i>, of having excited in him the taste for maxims, in
order to trouble his repose.&nbsp; The said Esprit was an
academician, and had been a frequenter of the H&ocirc;tel de
Rambouillet.&nbsp; He had already published &ldquo;Maxims in
Verse,&rdquo; and he subsequently produced a book called
&ldquo;La Faussete des Vertus Humaines,&rdquo; which seems to
consist of Rochefoucauldism become flat with an infusion of sour
Calvinism.&nbsp; Nevertheless, La Rochefoucauld seems to have
prized him, to have appealed to his judgment, and to have
concocted maxims with him, which he afterward begs him to submit
to Madame Sabl&eacute;.&nbsp; He sends a little batch of maxims
to her himself, and asks for an equivalent in the shape of good
eatables: &ldquo;Voil&agrave; tout ce que j&rsquo;ai de maximes;
mais <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>comme je ne donne rien pour rien, je vous demande un
potage aux carottes, un rago&ucirc;t de mouton,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp;
The taste and the talent enhanced each other; until, at last, La
Rochefoucauld began to be conscious of his pre-eminence in the
circle of maxim-mongers, and thought of a wider audience.&nbsp;
Thus grew up the famous &ldquo;Maxims,&rdquo; about which little
need be said.&nbsp; Every at once is now convinced, or professes
to be convinced, that, as to form, they are perfect, and that as
to matter, they are at once undeniably true and miserably false;
true as applied to that condition of human nature in which the
selfish instincts are still dominant, false if taken as a
representation of all the elements and possibilities of human
nature.&nbsp; We think La Rochefoucauld himself wavered as to
their universality, and that this wavering is indicated in the
qualified form of some of the maxims; it occasionally struck him
that the shadow of virtue must have a substance, but he had never
grasped that substance&mdash;it had never been present to his
consciousness.</p>
<p>It is curious to see La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s nervous anxiety
about presenting himself before the public as an author; far from
rushing into print, he stole into it, and felt his way by asking
private opinions.&nbsp; Through Madame de Sabl&eacute; he sent
manuscript copies to various persons of taste and talent, both
men and women, and many of the written opinions which he received
in reply are still in existence.&nbsp; The women generally find
the maxims distasteful, but the men write approvingly.&nbsp;
These men, however, are for the most part ecclesiastics, who
decry human nature that they may exalt divine grace.&nbsp; The
coincidence between Augustinianism or Calvinism, with its
doctrine of human corruption, and the hard cynicism of the
maxims, presents itself in quite a piquant form in some of the
laudatory opinions on La Rochefoucauld.&nbsp; One writer says:
&ldquo;On ne pourroit faire une instruction plus propre &agrave;
un catechum&egrave;ne pour convertir &agrave; Dieu son esprit et
sa volont&eacute; . . . Quand il n&rsquo;y auroit que cet escrit
au monde et l&rsquo;Evangile je voudrois etre chretien.&nbsp;
L&rsquo;un m&rsquo;apprendroit &agrave; connoistre mes
mis&egrave;res, et l&rsquo;autre &agrave; implorer mon
lib&eacute;rateur.&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>de Maintenon
tends word to La Rochefoucauld, after the publication of his
work, that the &ldquo;Book of Job&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Maxims&rdquo; are her only reading.</p>
<p>That Madame de Sabl&eacute; herself had a tolerably just idea
of La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s character, as well as of his maxims,
may be gathered not only from the fact that her own maxims are as
full of the confidence in human goodness which La Rochefoucauld
wants, as they are empty of the style which he possesses, but
also from a letter in which she replies to the criticisms of
Madame de Schomberg.&nbsp; &ldquo;The author,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;derived the maxim on indolence from his own disposition,
for never was there so great an indolence as his, and I think
that his heart, inert as it is, owes this defect as much to his
idleness as his will.&nbsp; It has never permitted him to do the
least action for others; and I think that, amid all his great
desires and great hopes, he is sometimes indolent even on his own
behalf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still she must have felt a hearty interest
in the &ldquo;Maxims,&rdquo; as in some degree her foster-child,
and she must also have had considerable affection for the author,
who was lovable enough to those who observed the rule of
Helvetius, and expected nothing from him.&nbsp; She not only
assisted him, as we have seen, in getting criticisms, and
carrying out the improvements suggested by them, but when the
book was actually published she prepared a notice of it for the
only journal then existing&mdash;the <i>Journal des
Savants</i>.&nbsp; This notice was originally a brief statement
of the nature of the work, and the opinions which had been formed
for and against it, with a moderate eulogy, in conclusion, on its
good sense, wit, and insight into human nature.&nbsp; But when
she submitted it to La Rochefoucauld he objected to the paragraph
which stated the adverse opinion, and requested her to alter
it.&nbsp; She, however, was either unable or unwilling to modify
her notice, and returned it with the following note:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Je vous envoie ce que j&rsquo;ai pu tirer
de ma teste pour mettre dans le <i>Journal des Savants</i>.&nbsp;
J&rsquo;y ai mis cet endroit qui vous est le plus sensible, afin
que cela vous fasse surmonter la mauvaise honte qui <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>vous
fit mettre la pr&eacute;face sans y rien retrancher, et je
n&rsquo;ai pas craint dele mettre, parce que je suis
assur&eacute;e que vous ne le ferez pas imprimer, quand
m&ecirc;me le reste vous plairoit.&nbsp; Je vous assure aussi que
je vous serai pins oblig&eacute;e, si vous en usez comme
d&rsquo;une chose qui servit &agrave; vous pour le corriger on
pour le jeter au feu.&nbsp; Nous autres grands auteurs, nous
sommes trop riches pour craindre de rien perdre de nos
productions.&nbsp; Mandez-moi ce qu&rsquo;il vous semble de ce
dictum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>La Rochefoucauld availed himself of this permission, and
&ldquo;edited&rdquo; the notice, touching up the style, and
leaving out the blame.&nbsp; In this revised form it appeared in
the <i>Journal des Savants</i>.&nbsp; In some points, we see, the
youth of journalism was not without promise of its future.</p>
<p>While Madame de Sabl&eacute; was thus playing the literary
confidante to La Rochefoucauld, and was the soul of a society
whose chief interest was the <i>belles-lettres</i>, she was
equally active in graver matters.&nbsp; She was in constant
intercourse or correspondence with the devout women of Port
Royal, and of the neighboring convent of the Carmelites, many of
whom had once been the ornaments of the court; and there is a
proof that she was conscious of being highly valued by them in
the fact that when the Princess Marie-Madeline, of the
Carmelites, was dangerously ill, not being able or not daring to
visit her, she sent her youthful portrait to be hung up in the
sick-room, and received from the same M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s,
whose grave admonition we have quoted above, a charming note,
describing the pleasure which the picture had given in the
infirmary of &ldquo;Notre bonne M&egrave;re.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was
interesting herself deeply in the translation of the New
Testament, which was the work of Sacy, Arnauld, Nicole, Le
Ma&icirc;tre, and the Duc de Luynes conjointly, Sacy having the
principal share.&nbsp; We have mentioned that Arnauld asked her
opinion on the &ldquo;Discourse&rdquo; prefixed to his
&ldquo;Logic,&rdquo; and we may conclude from this that he had
found her judgment valuable in many other cases.&nbsp; Moreover,
the persecution of the Port Royalists had commenced, and she was
uniting with Madame de Longueville in aiding and protecting her
pious friends.&nbsp; Moderate in her Jansenism, as in everything
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>else, she held that the famous formulary denouncing the
Augustinian doctrine, and declaring it to have been originated by
Jansenius, should be signed without reserve, and, as usual, she
had faith in conciliatory measures; but her moderation was no
excuse for inaction.&nbsp; She was at one time herself threatened
with the necessity of abandoning her residence at Port Royal, and
had thought of retiring to a religions house at Auteuil, a
village near Paris.&nbsp; She did, in fact, pass some summers
there, and she sometimes took refuge with her brother, the
Commandeur de Souvr&eacute;, with Madame de Montausier, or Madame
de Longueville.&nbsp; The last was much bolder in her
partisanship than her friend, and her superior wealth and
position enabled her to give the Port Royalists more efficient
aid.&nbsp; Arnauld and Nicole resided five years in her house; it
was under her protection that the translation of the New
Testament was carried on and completed, and it was chiefly
through her efforts that, in 1669, the persecution was brought to
an end.&nbsp; Madame de Sabl&eacute; co-operated with all her
talent and interest in the same direction; but here, as
elsewhere, her influence was chiefly valuable in what she
stimulated others to do, rather than in what she did
herself.&nbsp; It was by her that Madame de Longueville was first
won to the cause of Port Royal; and we find this ardent brave
woman constantly seeking the advice and sympathy of her more
timid and self-indulgent, but sincere and judicious friend.</p>
<p>In 1669, when Madame de Sabl&eacute; had at length rest from
these anxieties, she was at the good old age of seventy, but she
lived nine years longer&mdash;years, we may suppose, chiefly
dedicated to her spiritual concerns.&nbsp; This gradual, calm
decay allayed the fear of death, which had tormented her more
vigorous days; and she died with tranquillity and trust.&nbsp; It
is a beautiful trait of these last moments that she desired not
to be buried with her family, or even at Port Royal, among her
saintly and noble companions&mdash;but in the cemetery of her
parish, like one of the people, without pomp or ceremony.</p>
<p>It is worth while to notice, that with Madame de Sabl&eacute;,
as <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>with some other remarkable French women, the part of her
life which is richest in interest and results is that which is
looked forward to by most of her sex with melancholy as the
period of decline.&nbsp; When between fifty and sixty, she had
philosophers, wits, beauties, and saints clustering around her;
and one naturally cares to know what was the elixir which gave
her this enduring and general attraction.&nbsp; We think it was,
in a great degree, that well-balanced development of mental
powers which gave her a comprehension of varied intellectual
processes, and a tolerance for varied forms of character, which
is still rarer in women than in men.&nbsp; Here was one point of
distinction between her and Madame de Longueville; and an amusing
passage, which Sainte-Beuve has disinterred from the writings of
the Abb&eacute; St. Pierre, so well serves to indicate, by
contrast, what we regard as the great charm of Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s mind, that we shall not be wandering from
our subject in quoting it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I one day asked M. Nicole what was the
character of Mme. de Longueville&rsquo;s intellect; he told me it
was very subtle and delicate in the penetration of character; but
very small, very feeble, and that her comprehension was extremely
narrow in matters of science and reasoning, and on all
speculations that did not concern matters of sentiment.&nbsp; For
example, he added, I one day said to her that I could wager and
demonstrate that there were in Paris at least two inhabitants who
had the same number of hairs, although I could not point out who
these two men were.&nbsp; She told me I could never be sure of it
until I had counted the hairs of these two men.&nbsp; Here is my
demonstration, I said: I take it for granted that the head which
is most amply supplied with hairs has not more than 200,000, and
the head which is least so has but one hair.&nbsp; Now, if you
suppose that 200,000 heads have each a different number of hairs,
it necessarily follows that they have each one of the numbers of
hairs which form the series from one to 200,000; for if it were
supposed that there were two among these 200,000 who had the same
number of hairs, I should have gained my wager.&nbsp; Supposing,
then, that these 200,000 inhabitants have all a different number
of hairs, if I add a single inhabitant who has hairs, and who has
not more than 200,000, it necessarily follows that this number of
hairs, whatever it may be, will be contained in the series from
one to 200,000, and consequently will be equal to the number of
hairs on one of the previous 200,000 <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>inhabitants.&nbsp; Now as, instead of one inhabitant
more than 200,000, there an nearly 800,000 inhabitants in Paris,
you see clearly that there must be many heads which have an equal
number of hairs, though I have not counted them.&nbsp; Still Mme.
de Longueville could never comprehend that this equality of hairs
could be demonstrated, and always maintained that the only way of
proving it was to count them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely, the meet ardent admirer of feminine shallowness must
have felt some irritation when he found himself arrested by this
dead wall of stupidity, and have turned with relief to the larger
intelligence of Madame de Sabl&eacute;, who was not the less
graceful, delicate, and feminine because she could follow a train
of reasoning, or interest herself in a question of science.&nbsp;
In this combination consisted her pre-eminent charm: she was not
a genius, not a heroine, but a woman whom men could more than
love&mdash;whom they could make their friend, confidante, and
counsellor; the sharer, not of their joys and sorrows only, but
of their ideas and aims.</p>
<p>Such was Madame de Sabl&eacute;, whose name is, perhaps, new
to some of our readers, so far does it lie from the surface of
literature and history.&nbsp; We have seen, too, that she was
only one among a crowd&mdash;one in a firmament of feminine stars
which, when once the biographical telescope is turned upon them,
appear scarcely less remarkable and interesting.&nbsp; Now, if
the reader recollects what was the position and average
intellectual character of women in the high society of England
during the reigns of James the First and the two
Charleses&mdash;the period through which Madame de
Sabl&eacute;&rsquo;s career extends&mdash;we think he will admit
our position as to the early superiority of womanly development
in France, and this fact, with its causes, has not merely an
historical interest: it has an important bearing on the culture
of women in the present day.&nbsp; Women become superior in
France by being admitted to a common fund of ideas, to common
objects of interest with men; and this must ever be the essential
condition at once of true womanly culture and of true social
well-being.&nbsp; We have no faith in feminine conversazioni,
where ladies are eloquent on Apollo <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>and Mars;
though we sympathize with the yearning activity of faculties
which, deprived of their proper material, waste themselves in
weaving fabrics out of cobwebs.&nbsp; Let the whole field of
reality be laid open to woman as well as to man, and then that
which is peculiar in her mental modification, instead of being,
as it is now, a source of discord and repulsion between the
sexes, will be found to be a necessary complement to the truth
and beauty of life.&nbsp; Then we shall have that marriage of
minds which alone can blend all the hues of thought and feeling
in one lovely rainbow of promise for the harvest of human
happiness.</p>

64</span>III.&nbsp; EVANGELICAL TEACHING: DR. CUMMING. <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a></h3>
<p>Given, a man with moderate intellect, a moral standard not
higher than the average, some rhetorical affluence and great
glibness of speech, what is the career in which, without the aid
of birth or money, he may most easily attain power and reputation
in English society?&nbsp; Where is that Goshen of mediocrity in
which a smattering of science and learning will pass for profound
instruction, where platitudes will be accepted as wisdom, bigoted
narrowness as holy zeal, unctuous egoism as God-given
piety?&nbsp; Let such a man become an evangelical preacher; he
will then find it possible to reconcile small ability with great
ambition, superficial knowledge with the prestige of erudition, a
middling morale with a high reputation for sanctity.&nbsp; Let
him shun practical extremes and be ultra only in what is purely
theoretic; let him be stringent on predestination, but
latitudinarian on fasting; unflinching in insisting on the
Eternity of punishment, but diffident of curtailing the
substantial comforts <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>of Time; ardent and imaginative on
the pro-millennial advent of Christ, but cold and cautious toward
every other infringement of the <i>status quo</i>.&nbsp; Let him
fish for souls not with the bait of inconvenient singularity, but
with the drag-net of comfortable conformity.&nbsp; Let him be
hard and literal in his interpretation only when he wants to hurl
texts at the heads of unbelievers and adversaries, but when the
letter of the Scriptures presses too closely on the genteel
Christianity of the nineteenth century, let him use his
spiritualizing alembic and disperse it into impalpable
ether.&nbsp; Let him preach less of Christ than of Antichrist;
let him be less definite in showing what sin is than in showing
who is the Man of Sin, less expansive on the blessedness of faith
than on the accursedness of infidelity.&nbsp; Above all, let him
set up as an interpreter of prophecy, and rival Moore&rsquo;s
Almanack in the prediction of political events, tickling the
interest of hearers who are but moderately spiritual by showing
how the Holy Spirit has dictated problems and charades for their
benefit, and how, if they are ingenious enough to solve these,
they may have their Christian graces nourished by learning
precisely to whom they may point as the &ldquo;horn that had
eyes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the lying prophet,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;unclean spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this way he will draw men
to him by the strong cords of their passions, made reason-proof
by being baptized with the name of piety.&nbsp; In this way he
may gain a metropolitan pulpit; the avenues to his church will be
as crowded as the passages to the opera; he has but to print his
prophetic sermons and bind them in lilac and gold, and they will
adorn the drawing-room table of all evangelical ladies, who will
regard as a sort of pious &ldquo;light reading&rdquo; the
demonstration that the prophecy of the locusts whose sting is in
their tail, is fulfilled in the fact of the Turkish
commander&rsquo;s having taken a horse&rsquo;s tail for his
standard, and that the French are the very frogs predicted in the
Revelations.</p>
<p>Pleasant to the clerical flesh under such circumstances is the
arrival of Sunday!&nbsp; Somewhat at a disadvantage during the
week, in the presence of working-day interests and lay splendors,
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>on Sunday the preacher becomes the cynosure of a
thousand eyes, and predominates at once over the Amphitryon with
whom he dines, and the most captious member of his church or
vestry.&nbsp; He has an immense advantage over all other public
speakers.&nbsp; The platform orator is subject to the criticism
of hisses and groans.&nbsp; Counsel for the plaintiff expects the
retort of counsel for the defendant.&nbsp; The honorable
gentleman on one side of the House is liable to have his facts
and figures shown up by his honorable friend on the opposite
side.&nbsp; Even the scientific or literary lecturer, if he is
dull or incompetent, may see the best part of his audience
quietly slip out one by one.&nbsp; But the preacher is completely
master of the situation: no one may hiss, no one may
depart.&nbsp; Like the writer of imaginary conversations, he may
put what imbecilities he pleases into the mouths of his
antagonists, and swell with triumph when he has refuted
them.&nbsp; He may riot in gratuitous assertions, confident that
no man will contradict him; he may exercise perfect free-will in
logic, and invent illustrative experience; he may give an
evangelical edition of history with the inconvenient facts
omitted:&mdash;all this he may do with impunity, certain that
those of his hearers who are not sympathizing are not
listening.&nbsp; For the Press has no band of critics who go the
round of the churches and chapels, and are on the watch for a
slip or defect in the preacher, to make a &ldquo;feature&rdquo;
in their article: the clergy are, practically, the most
irresponsible of all talkers.&nbsp; For this reason, at least, it
is well that they do not always allow their discourses to be
merely fugitive, but are often induced to fix them in that black
and white in which they are open to the criticism of any man who
has the courage and patience to treat them with thorough freedom
of speech and pen.</p>
<p>It is because we think this criticism of clerical teaching
desirable for the public good that we devote some pages to Dr.
Cumming.&nbsp; He is, as every one knows, a preacher of immense
popularity, and of the numerous publications in which he
perpetuates his pulpit labors, all circulate widely, and some,
according <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>to their title-page, have reached the
sixteenth thousand.&nbsp; Now our opinion of these publications
is the very opposite of that given by a newspaper eulogist: we do
<i>not</i> &ldquo;believe that the repeated issues of Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s thoughts are having a beneficial effect on
society,&rdquo; but the reverse; and hence, little inclined as we
are to dwell on his pages, we think it worth while to do so, for
the sake of pointing out in them what we believe to be profoundly
mistaken and pernicious.&nbsp; Of Dr. Cumming personally we know
absolutely nothing: our acquaintance with him is confined to a
perusal of his works, our judgment of him is founded solely on
the manner in which he has written himself down on his
pages.&nbsp; We know neither how he looks nor how he lives.&nbsp;
We are ignorant whether, like St. Paul, he has a bodily presence
that is weak and contemptible, or whether his person is as florid
and as prone to amplification as his style.&nbsp; For aught we
know, he may not only have the gift of prophecy, but may bestow
the profits of all his works to feed the poor, and be ready to
give his own body to be burned with as much alacrity as he infers
the everlasting burning of Roman Catholics and Puseyites.&nbsp;
Out of the pulpit he may be a model of justice, truthfulness, and
the love that thinketh no evil; but we are obliged to judge of
his charity by the spirit we find in his sermons, and shall only
be glad to learn that his practice is, in many respects, an
amiable <i>non sequitur</i> from his teaching.</p>
<p>Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s mind is evidently not of the pietistic
order.&nbsp; There is not the slightest leaning toward mysticism
in his Christianity&mdash;no indication of religious raptures, of
delight in God, of spiritual communion with the Father.&nbsp; He
is most at home in the forensic view of Justification, and dwells
on salvation as a scheme rather than as an experience.&nbsp; He
insists on good works as the sign of justifying faith, as labors
to be achieved to the glory of God, but he rarely represents them
as the spontaneous, necessary outflow of a soul filled with
Divine love.&nbsp; He is at home in the external, the polemical,
the historical, the circumstantial, and is only episodically
devout and <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>practical.&nbsp; The great majority
of his published sermons are occupied with argument or philippic
against Romanists and unbelievers, with
&ldquo;vindications&rdquo; of the Bible, with the political
interpretation of prophecy, or the criticism of public events;
and the devout aspiration, or the spiritual and practical
exhortation, is tacked to them as a sort of fringe in a hurried
sentence or two at the end.&nbsp; He revels in the demonstration
that the Pope is the Man of Sin; he is copious on the downfall of
the Ottoman empire; he appears to glow with satisfaction in
turning a story which tends to show how he abashed an
&ldquo;infidel;&rdquo; it is a favorite exercise with him to form
conjectures of the process by which the earth is to be burned up,
and to picture Dr. Chalmers and Mr. Wilberforce being caught up
to meet Christ in the air, while Romanists, Puseyites, and
infidels are given over to gnashing of teeth.&nbsp; But of really
spiritual joys and sorrows, of the life and death of Christ as a
manifestation of love that constrains the soul, of sympathy with
that yearning over the lost and erring which made Jesus weep over
Jerusalem, and prompted the sublime prayer, &ldquo;Father,
forgive them,&rdquo; of the gentler fruits of the Spirit, and the
peace of God which passeth understanding&mdash;of all this, we
find little trace in Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s discourses.</p>
<p>His style is in perfect correspondence with this habit of
mind.&nbsp; Though diffuse, as that of all preachers must be, it
has rapidity of movement, perfect clearness, and some aptness of
illustration.&nbsp; He has much of that literary talent which
makes a good journalist&mdash;the power of beating out an idea
over a large space, and of introducing far-fetched <i>&agrave;
propos</i>.&nbsp; His writings have, indeed, no high merit: they
have no originality or force of thought, no striking felicity of
presentation, no depth of emotion.&nbsp; Throughout nine volumes
we have alighted on no passage which impressed us as worth
extracting, and placing among the &ldquo;beauties,&rdquo; of
evangelical writers, such as Robert Hall, Foster the Essayist, or
Isaac Taylor.&nbsp; Everywhere there is commonplace cleverness,
nowhere a spark of rare <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>thought, of lofty sentiment, or
pathetic tenderness.&nbsp; We feel ourselves in company with a
voluble retail talker, whose language is exuberant but not exact,
and to whom we should never think of referring for precise
information or for well-digested thought and experience.&nbsp;
His argument continually slides into wholesale assertion and
vague declamation, and in his love of ornament he frequently
becomes tawdry.&nbsp; For example, he tells us (&ldquo;Apoc.
Sketches,&rdquo; p. 265) that &ldquo;Botany weaves around the
cross her amaranthine garlands; and Newton comes from his starry
home&mdash;Linn&aelig;us from his flowery resting-place&mdash;and
Werner and Hutton from their subterranean graves at the voice of
Chalmers, to acknowledge that all they learned and elicited in
their respective provinces has only served to show more clearly
that Jesus of Nazareth is enthroned on the riches of the
universe:&rdquo;&mdash;and so prosaic an injunction to his
hearers as that they should choose a residence within an easy
distance of church, is magnificently draped by him as an
exportation to prefer a house &ldquo;that basks in the sunshine
of the countenance of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like all preachers of his
class, he is more fertile in imaginative paraphrase than in close
exposition, and in this way he gives us some remarkable fragments
of what we may call the romance of Scripture, filling up the
outline of the record with an elaborate coloring quite undreamed
of by more literal minds.&nbsp; The serpent, he informs us, said
to Eve, &ldquo;Can it be so?&nbsp; Surely you are mistaken, that
God hath said you shall die, a creature so fair, so lovely, so
beautiful.&nbsp; It is impossible.&nbsp; <i>The laws of nature
and physical science tell you that my interpretation is
correct</i>; you shall not die.&nbsp; I can tell you by my own
experience as an angel that you shall be as gods, knowing good
and evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Apoc. Sketches,&rdquo; p.
294.)&nbsp; Again, according to Dr. Cumming, Abel had so clear an
idea of the Incarnation and Atonement, that when he offered his
sacrifice &ldquo;he must have said, &lsquo;I feel myself a guilty
sinner, and that in myself I cannot meet thee alive; I lay on
thine altar this victim, and I shed its blood as my testimony
that mine should be shed; and I look for forgiveness and
undeserved mercy through <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>him who is to
bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head, and whose atonement this
typifies.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Occas. Disc.&rdquo; vol. i.
p. 23.)&nbsp; Indeed, his productions are essentially ephemeral;
he is essentially a journalist, who writes sermons instead of
leading articles, who, instead of venting diatribes against her
Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers, directs his power of invective against
Cardinal Wiseman and the Puseyites; instead of declaiming on
public spirit, perorates on the &ldquo;glory of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We fancy he is called, in the more refined evangelical circles,
an &ldquo;intellectual preacher;&rdquo; by the plainer sort of
Christians, a &ldquo;flowery preacher;&rdquo; and we are inclined
to think that the more spiritually minded class of believers, who
look with greater anxiety for the kingdom of God within them than
for the visible advent of Christ in 1864, will be likely to find
Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s declamatory flights and historico-prophetical
exercitations as little better than &ldquo;clouts o&rsquo; cauld
parritch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is our general impression from his writings after an
attentive perusal.&nbsp; There are some particular
characteristics which we shall consider more closely, but in
doing so we must be understood as altogether declining any
doctrinal discussion.&nbsp; We have no intention to consider the
grounds of Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s dogmatic system, to examine the
principles of his prophetic exegesis, or to question his opinion
concerning the little horn, the river Euphrates, or the seven
vials.&nbsp; We identify ourselves with no one of the bodies whom
he regards it as his special mission to attack: we give our
adhesion neither to Romanism, Puseyism, nor to that anomalous
combination of opinions which he introduces to us under the name
of infidelity.&nbsp; It is simply as spectators that we criticise
Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s mode of warfare, and we concern ourselves
less with what he holds to be Christian truth than with his
manner of enforcing that truth, less with the doctrines he
teaches than with the moral spirit and tendencies of his
teaching.</p>
<p>One of the most striking characteristics of Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s writings is <i>unscrupulosity of
statement</i>.&nbsp; His motto apparently is,
<i>Christianitatem</i>, <i>quocunque modo</i>,
<i>Christianitatem</i>; and the <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>only system
he includes under the term Christianity is Calvinistic
Protestantism.&nbsp; Experience has so long shown that the human
brain is a congenial nidus for inconsistent beliefs that we do
not pause to inquire how Dr. Cumming, who attributes the
conversion of the unbelieving to the Divine Spirit, can think it
necessary to co-operate with that Spirit by argumentative white
lies.&nbsp; Nor do we for a moment impugn the genuineness of his
zeal for Christianity, or the sincerity of his conviction that
the doctrines he preaches are necessary to salvation; on the
contrary, we regard the flagrant unveracity that we find on his
pages as an indirect result of that conviction&mdash;as a result,
namely, of the intellectual and moral distortion of view which is
inevitably produced by assigning to dogmas, based on a very
complex structure of evidence, the place and authority of first
truths.&nbsp; A distinct appreciation of the value of
evidence&mdash;in other words, the intellectual perception of
truth&mdash;is more closely allied to truthfulness of statement,
or the moral quality of veracity, than is generally
admitted.&nbsp; There is not a more pernicious fallacy afloat, in
common parlance, than the wide distinction made between intellect
and morality.&nbsp; Amiable impulses without intellect, man may
have in common with dogs and horses; but morality, which is
specifically human, is dependent on the regulation of feeling by
intellect.&nbsp; All human beings who can be said to be in any
degree moral have their impulses guided, not indeed always by
their own intellect, but by the intellect of human beings who
have gone before them, and created traditions and associations
which have taken the rank of laws.&nbsp; Now that highest moral
habit, the constant preference of truth, both theoretically and
practically, pre-eminently demands the co-operation of the
intellect with the impulses, as is indicated by the fact that it
is only found in anything like completeness in the highest class
of minds.&nbsp; In accordance with this we think it is found
that, in proportion as religious sects exalt feeling above
intellect, and believe themselves to be guided by direct
inspiration rather than by a spontaneous exertion of their
faculties&mdash;that is, in proportion as <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>they are
removed from rationalism&mdash;their sense of truthfulness is
misty and confused.&nbsp; No one can have talked to the more
enthusiastic Methodists and listened to their stories of miracles
without perceiving that they require no other passport to a
statement than that it accords with their wishes and their
general conception of God&rsquo;s dealings; nay, they regard as a
symptom of sinful scepticism an inquiry into the evidence for a
story which they think unquestionably tends to the glory of God,
and in retailing such stories, new particulars, further tending
to his glory, are &ldquo;borne in&rdquo; upon their minds.&nbsp;
Now, Dr. Cumming, as we have said, is no enthusiastic pietist:
within a certain circle&mdash;within the mill of evangelical
orthodoxy&mdash;his intellect is perpetually at work; but that
principle of sophistication which our friends the Methodists
derive from the predominance of their pietistic feelings, is
involved for him in the doctrine of verbal inspiration; what is
for them a state of emotion submerging the intellect, is with him
a formula imprisoning the intellect, depriving it of its proper
function&mdash;the free search for truth&mdash;and making it the
mere servant-of-all-work to a foregone conclusion.&nbsp; Minds
fettered by this doctrine no longer inquire concerning a
proposition whether it is attested by sufficient evidence, but
whether it accords with Scripture; they do not search for facts,
as such, but for facts that will bear out their doctrine.&nbsp;
They become accustomed to reject the more direct evidence in
favor of the less direct, and where adverse evidence reaches
demonstration they must resort to devices and expedients in order
to explain away contradiction.&nbsp; It is easy to see that this
mental habit blunts not only the perception of truth, but the
sense of truthfulness, and that the man whose faith drives him
into fallacies treads close upon the precipice of falsehood.</p>
<p>We have entered into this digression for the sake of
mitigating the inference that is likely to be drawn from that
characteristic of Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s works to which we have
pointed.&nbsp; He is much in the same intellectual condition as
that professor of Padua; who, in order to disprove
Galileo&rsquo;s discovery of <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites, urged that as there were
only seven metals there could not be more than seven
planets&mdash;a mental condition scarcely compatible with
candor.&nbsp; And we may well suppose that if the professor had
held the belief in seven planets, and no more, to be a necessary
condition of salvation, his mental condition would have been so
dazed that even if he had consented to look through
Galileo&rsquo;s telescope, his eyes would have reported in
accordance with his inward alarms rather than with the external
fact.&nbsp; So long as a belief in propositions is regarded as
indispensable to salvation, the pursuit of truth <i>as such</i>
is not possible, any more than it is possible for a man who is
swimming for his life to make meteorological observations on the
storm which threatens to overwhelm him.&nbsp; The sense of alarm
and haste, the anxiety for personal safety, which Dr. Cumming
insists upon as the proper religious attitude, unmans the nature,
and allows no thorough, calm thinking no truly noble,
disinterested feeling.&nbsp; Hence, we by no means suspect that
the unscrupulosity of statement with which we charge Dr. Cumming,
extends beyond the sphere of his theological prejudices; we do
not doubt that, religion apart, he appreciates and practices
veracity.</p>
<p>A grave general accusation must be supported by details, and
in adducing those we purposely select the most obvious cases of
misrepresentation&mdash;such as require no argument to expose
them, but can be perceived at a glance.&nbsp; Among Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s numerous books, one of the most notable for
unscrupulosity of statement is the &ldquo;Manual of Christian
Evidences,&rdquo; written, as he tells us in his Preface, not to
give the deepest solutions of the difficulties in question, but
to furnish Scripture Readers, City Missionaries, and Sunday
School Teachers, with a &ldquo;ready reply&rdquo; to sceptical
arguments.&nbsp; This announcement that <i>readiness</i> was the
chief quality sought for in the solutions here given, modifies
our inference from the other qualities which those solutions
present; and it is but fair to presume that when the Christian
disputant is not in a hurry Dr. Cumming would recommend replies
less ready and more <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>veracious.&nbsp; Here is an example
of what in another place <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a> he tells his readers
is &ldquo;change in their pocket . . . a little ready argument
which they can employ, and therewith answer a fool according to
his folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the nature of this argumentative
small coin, we are inclined to think Dr. Cumming understands
answering a fool according to his folly to mean, giving him a
foolish answer.&nbsp; We quote from the &ldquo;Manual of
Christian Evidences,&rdquo; p. 62.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some of the gods which the heathen
worshipped were among the greatest monsters that ever walked the
earth.&nbsp; Mercury was a thief; and because he was an expert
thief he was enrolled among the gods.&nbsp; Bacchus was a mere
sensualist and drunkard, and therefore he was enrolled among the
gods.&nbsp; Venus was a dissipated and abandoned courtesan, and
therefore she was enrolled among the goddesses.&nbsp; Mars was a
savage, that gloried in battle and in blood, and therefore he was
deified and enrolled among the gods.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Dr. Cumming believe the purport of these sentences?&nbsp;
If so, this passage is worth handing down as his theory of the
Greek myth&mdash;as a specimen of the astounding ignorance which
was possible in a metropolitan preacher, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1854.&nbsp; And if he does not believe
them . . . The inference must then be, that he thinks delicate
veracity about the ancient Greeks is not a Christian virtue, but
only a &ldquo;splendid sin&rdquo; of the unregenerate.&nbsp; This
inference is rendered the more probable by our finding, a little
further on, that he is not more scrupulous about the moderns, if
they come under his definition of &ldquo;Infidels.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the passage we are about to quote in proof of this has a
worse quality than its discrepancy with fact.&nbsp; Who that has
a spark of generous feeling, that rejoices in the presence of
good in a fellow-being, has not dwelt with pleasure on the
thought that Lord Byron&rsquo;s unhappy career was ennobled and
purified toward its close by a high and sympathetic purpose, by
honest and energetic efforts for his fellow-men?&nbsp; Who has
not read with deep emotion those last pathetic lines, beautiful
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>as the after-glow of sunset, in which love and
resignation are mingled with something of a melancholy
heroism?&nbsp; Who has not lingered with compassion over the
dying scene at Missolonghi&mdash;the sufferer&rsquo;s inability
to make his farewell messages of love intelligible, and the last
long hours of silent pain?&nbsp; Yet for the sake of furnishing
his disciples with a &ldquo;ready reply,&rdquo; Dr. Cumming can
prevail on himself to inoculate them with a bad-spirited falsity
like the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have one striking exhibition of <i>an
infidel&rsquo;s brightest thoughts</i>, in some lines <i>written
in his dying moments</i> by a man, gifted with great genius,
capable of prodigious intellectual prowess, but of worthless
principle, and yet more worthless practices&mdash;I mean the
celebrated Lord Byron.&nbsp; He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Though gay companions o&rsquo;er the bowl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dispel awhile the sense of ill,<br />
Though pleasure fills the maddening soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart&mdash;<i>the heart</i> is lonely
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, but to die, and go, alas!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where all have gone and all must go;<br />
To be the <i>Nothing</i> that I was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere born to life and living woe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Count o&rsquo;er the joys thine hours have
seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Count o&rsquo;er thy days from anguish free,<br />
And know, whatever thou hast been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tis <i>something better</i> not to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, for myself, so dark my fate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through every turn of life hath been,<br />
<i>Man</i> and the <i>world</i> so much <i>I hate</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I care not when I quit the scene.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to suppose that Dr. Cumming can have been so
grossly imposed upon&mdash;that he can be so ill-informed as
really to believe that these lines were &ldquo;written&rdquo; by
Lord Byron in his dying moments; but, allowing him the full
benefit of that possibility, how shall we explain his
introduction of this feebly rabid doggrel as &ldquo;an
infidel&rsquo;s brightest thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In marshalling the evidences of Christianity, Dr. Cumming
directs most of his arguments against opinions that are either
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>totally imaginary, or that belong to the past rather
than to the present, while he entirely fails to meet the
difficulties actually felt and urged by those who are unable to
accept Revelation.&nbsp; There can hardly be a stronger proof of
misconception as to the character of free-thinking in the present
day, than the recommendation of Leland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Short and
Easy Method with the Deists&rdquo;&mdash;a method which is
unquestionably short and easy for preachers disinclined to
reconsider their stereotyped modes of thinking and arguing, but
which has quite ceased to realize those epithets in the
conversion of Deists.&nbsp; Yet Dr. Cumming not only recommends
this book, but takes the trouble himself to write a feebler
version of its arguments.&nbsp; For example, on the question of
the genuineness and authenticity of the New Testament
writing&rsquo;s, he says: &ldquo;If, therefore, at a period long
subsequent to the death of Christ, a number of men had appeared
in the world, drawn up a book which they christened by the name
of the Holy Scripture, and recorded these things which appear in
it as facts when they were only the fancies of their own
imagination, surely the <i>Jews</i> would have instantly
reclaimed that no such events transpired, that no such person as
Jesus Christ appeared in their capital, and that <i>their</i>
crucifixion of Him, and their alleged evil treatment of his
apostles, were mere fictions.&rdquo; <a name="citation76"></a><a
href="#footnote76" class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; It is scarcely
necessary to say that, in such argument as this, Dr. Cumming is
beating the air.&nbsp; He is meeting a hypothesis which no one
holds, and totally missing the real question.&nbsp; The only type
of &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; whose existence Dr. Cumming recognizes
is that fossil personage who &ldquo;calls the Bible a lie and a
forgery.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seems to be ignorant&mdash;or he chooses
to ignore the fact&mdash;that there is a large body of eminently
instructed and earnest men who regard the Hebrew and Christian
Scriptures as a series of historical documents, to be dealt with
according to the rules of historical criticism, and that an
equally large number of men, who are not historical critics, find
<!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>the dogmatic scheme built on the letter of the
Scriptures opposed to their profoundest moral convictions.&nbsp;
Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s infidel is a man who, because his life is
vicious, tries to convince himself that there is no God, and that
Christianity is an imposture, but who is all the while secretly
conscious that he is opposing the truth, and cannot help
&ldquo;letting out&rdquo; admissions &ldquo;that the Bible is the
Book of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are favored with the following
&ldquo;Creed of the Infidel:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I believe that there is no God, but that
matter is God, and God is matter; and that it is no matter
whether there is any God or not.&nbsp; I believe also that the
world was not made, but that the world made itself, or that it
had no beginning, and that it will last forever.&nbsp; I believe
that man is a beast; that the soul is the body, and that the body
is the soul; and that after death there is neither body nor
soul.&nbsp; I believe there is no religion, that <i>natural
religion is the only religion</i>, <i>and all religion
unnatural</i>.&nbsp; I believe not in Moses; I believe in the
first philosophers.&nbsp; I believe not in the evangelists; I
believe in Chubb, Collins, Toland, Tindal, and Hobbes.&nbsp; I
believe in Lord Bolingbroke, and I believe not in St. Paul.&nbsp;
I believe not in revelation; <i>I believe in tradition</i>; <i>I
believe in the Talmud</i>; <i>I believe in the Koran</i>; I
believe not in the Bible.&nbsp; I believe in Socrates; I believe
in Confucius; I believe in Mahomet; I believe not in
Christ.&nbsp; And lastly, <i>I believe</i> in all
unbelief.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intellectual and moral monster whose creed is this complex
web of contradictions, is, moreover, according to Dr. Cumming, a
being who unites much simplicity and imbecility with his Satanic
hardihood&mdash;much tenderness of conscience with his obdurate
vice.&nbsp; Hear the &ldquo;proof:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I once met with an acute and enlightened
infidel, with whom I reasoned day after day, and for hours
together; I submitted to him the internal, the external, and the
experimental evidences, but made no impression on his scorn and
unbelief.&nbsp; At length I entertained a suspicion that there
was something morally, rather than intellectually wrong, and that
the bias was not in the intellect, but in the heart; one day
therefore I said to him, &lsquo;I must now state my conviction,
and you may call me uncharitable, but duty compels me; you are
living in some known and gross sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>The
man&rsquo;s countenance became pale</i>; <i>he bowed and left
me</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Man. of Evidences,&rdquo; p. 254.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>Here we have the remarkable psychological phenomenon of
an &ldquo;acute and enlightened&rdquo; man who, deliberately
purposing to indulge in a favorite sin, and regarding the Gospel
with scorn and unbelief, is, nevertheless, so much more
scrupulous than the majority of Christians, that he cannot
&ldquo;embrace sin and the Gospel simultaneously;&rdquo; who is
so alarmed at the Gospel in which he does not believe, that he
cannot be easy without trying to crush it; whose acuteness and
enlightenment suggest to him, as a means of crushing the Gospel,
to argue from day to day with Dr. Cumming; and who is withal so
na&iuml;ve that he is taken by surprise when Dr. Cumming, failing
in argument, resorts to accusation, and so tender in conscience
that, at the mention of his sin, he turns pale and leaves the
spot.&nbsp; If there be any human mind in existence capable of
holding Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creed of the Infidel,&rdquo;
of at the same time believing in tradition and &ldquo;believing
in all unbelief,&rdquo; it must be the mind of the infidel just
described, for whose existence we have Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s <i>ex
officio</i> word as a theologian; and to theologians we may apply
what Sancho Panza says of the bachelors of Salamanca, that they
never tell lies&mdash;except when it suits their purpose.</p>
<p>The total absence from Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s theological mind of
any demarcation between fact and rhetoric is exhibited in another
passage, where he adopts the dramatic form:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ask the peasant on the hills&mdash;and <i>I
have asked amid the mountains of Braemar and
Deeside</i>&mdash;&lsquo;How do you know that this book is
divine, and that the religion you profess is true?&nbsp; You
never read Paley?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I never heard of
him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You have never read Butler?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, I have never heard of him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nor
Chalmers?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I do not know
him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You have never read any books on
evidence?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I have read no such
books.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Then, how do you know this book is
true?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Know it!&nbsp; Tell me that the Dee,
the Clunie, and the Garrawalt, the streams at my feet, do not
run; that the winds do not sigh amid the gorges of these blue
hills; that the sun does not kindle the peaks of Loch-na-Gar;
tell me my heart does not beat, and I will believe you; but do
not tell me the Bible is not divine.&nbsp; I have found its truth
illuminating my footsteps; its consolations sustaining my
heart.&nbsp; May <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>my tongue cleave to my mouth&rsquo;s
roof and my right hand forget its cunning, if I every deny what
is my deepest inner experience, that this blessed book is the
book of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Church Before the
Flood,&rdquo; p. 35.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Cumming is so slippery and lax in his mode of presentation
that we find it impossible to gather whether he means to assert
that this is what a peasant on the mountains of Braemar
<i>did</i> say, or that it is what such a peasant <i>would</i>
say: in the one case, the passage may be taken as a measure of
his truthfulness; in the other, of his judgment.</p>
<p>His own faith, apparently, has not been altogether intuitive,
like that of his rhetorical peasant, for he tells us
(&ldquo;Apoc. Sketches,&rdquo; p. 405) that he has himself
experienced what it is to have religious doubts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was tainted while at the University by this spirit of
scepticism.&nbsp; I thought Christianity might not be true.&nbsp;
The very possibility of its being true was the thought I felt I
must meet and settle.&nbsp; Conscience could give me no peace
till I had settled it.&nbsp; I read, and I read from that day,
for fourteen or fifteen years, till this, and now I am as
convinced, upon the clearest evidence, that this book is the book
of God as that I now address you.&rdquo;&nbsp; This experience,
however, instead of impressing on him the fact that doubt may be
the stamp of a truth-loving mind&mdash;that <i>sunt quibus non
credidisse honor est</i>, <i>et fidei futur&aelig;
pignus</i>&mdash;seems to have produced precisely the contrary
effect.&nbsp; It has not enabled him even to conceive the
condition of a mind &ldquo;perplext in faith but pure in
deeds,&rdquo; craving light, yearning for a faith that will
harmonize and cherish its highest powers and aspirations, but
unable to find that faith in dogmatic Christianity.&nbsp; His own
doubts apparently were of a different kind.&nbsp; Nowhere in his
pages have we found a humble, candid, sympathetic attempt to meet
the difficulties that may be felt by an ingenuous mind.&nbsp;
Everywhere he supposes that the doubter is hardened, conceited,
consciously shutting his eyes to the light&mdash;a fool who is to
be answered according to his folly&mdash;that is, with ready
replies made up of reckless assertions, of apocryphal <!-- page
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>anecdotes, and, where other resources fail, of
vituperative imputation.&nbsp; As to the reading which he has
prosecuted for fifteen years&mdash;<i>either</i> it has left him
totally ignorant of the relation which his own religions creed
bears to the criticism and philosophy of the nineteenth century,
or he systematically blinks that criticism and that philosophy;
and instead of honestly and seriously endeavoring to meet and
solve what he knows to be the real difficulties, contents himself
with setting up popinjays to shoot at, for the sake of confirming
the ignorance and winning the heap admiration of his evangelical
hearers and readers.&nbsp; Like the Catholic preacher who, after
throwing down his cap and apostrophizing it as Luther, turned to
his audience and said, &ldquo;You see this heretical fellow has
not a word to say for himself,&rdquo; Dr. Cumming, having drawn
his ugly portrait of the infidel, and put arguments of a
convenient quality into his mouth, finds a &ldquo;short and easy
method&rdquo; of confounding this &ldquo;croaking
frog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his treatment of infidels, we imagine he is guided by a
mental process which may be expressed in the following syllogism:
Whatever tends to the glory of God is true; it is for the glory
of God that infidels should be as bad as possible; therefore,
whatever tends to show that infidels are as bad as possible is
true.&nbsp; All infidels, he tells us, have been men of
&ldquo;gross and licentious lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there not some
well-known unbeliever, David Hume, for example, of whom even Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s readers may have heard as an exception?&nbsp; No
matter.&nbsp; Some one suspected that he was <i>not</i> an
exception, and as that suspicion tends to the glory of God, it is
one for a Christian to entertain.&nbsp; (See &ldquo;Man. of
Ev.,&rdquo; p. 73.)&mdash;If we were unable to imagine this kind
of self-sophistication, we should be obliged to suppose that,
relying on the ignorance of his evangelical disciples, he fed
them with direct and conscious falsehoods.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Voltaire,&rdquo; he informs them, &ldquo;declares there is
no God;&rdquo; he was &ldquo;an antitheist, that is one who
deliberately and avowedly opposed and hated God; who swore in his
blasphemy that he would dethrone him;&rdquo; and &ldquo;advocated
<!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>the very depths of the lowest sensuality.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With regard to many statements of a similar kind, equally at
variance with truth, in Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s volumes, we presume
that he has been misled by hearsay or by the second-hand
character of his acquaintance with free-thinking
literature.&nbsp; An evangelical preacher is not obliged to be
well-read.&nbsp; Here, however, is a case which the extremest
supposition of educated ignorance will not reach.&nbsp; Even
books of &ldquo;evidences&rdquo; quote from Voltaire the
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Si Dieu n&rsquo;existait pas, il faudrait
l&rsquo;inventer;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>even persons fed on the mere whey and buttermilk of literature
must know that in philosophy Voltaire was nothing if not a
theist&mdash;must know that he wrote not against God, but against
Jehovah, the God of the Jews, whom he believed to be a false
God&mdash;must know that to say Voltaire was an atheist on this
ground is as absurd as to say that a Jacobite opposed hereditary
monarchy because he declared the Brunswick family had no title to
the throne.&nbsp; That Dr. Cumming should repeat the vulgar
fables about Voltaire&rsquo;s death is merely what we might
expect from the specimens we have seen of his illustrative
stories.&nbsp; A man whose accounts of his own experience are
apocryphal is not likely to put borrowed narratives to any severe
test.</p>
<p>The alliance between intellectual and moral perversion is
strikingly typified by the way in which he alternates from the
unveracious to the absurd, from misrepresentation to
contradiction.&nbsp; Side by side with the abduction of
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; such as those we have quoted, we find him
arguing on one page that the Trinity was too grand a doctrine to
have been conceived by man, and was <i>therefore</i> Divine; and
on another page, that the Incarnation <i>had</i> been
preconceived by man, and is <i>therefore</i> to be accepted as
Divine.&nbsp; But we are less concerned with the fallacy of his
&ldquo;ready replies&rdquo; than with their falsity; and even of
this we can only afford space for a very few specimens.&nbsp;
Here is one: &ldquo;There is a <i>thousand times</i> more proof
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>that the gospel of John was written by him than there is
that the
<i>&Alpha;&nu;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</i> was
written by Xenophon, or the Ars Poetica by Horace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If Dr. Cumming had chosen Plato&rsquo;s Epistles or
Anacreon&rsquo;s Poems instead of the Anabasis or the Ars
Poetica, he would have reduced the extent of the falsehood, and
would have furnished a ready reply which would have been equally
effective with his Sunday-school teachers and their
disputants.&nbsp; Hence we conclude this prodigality of
misstatement, this exuberance of mendacity, is an effervescence
of zeal <i>in majorem gloriam Dei</i>.&nbsp; Elsewhere he tells
us that &ldquo;the idea of the author of the
&lsquo;Vestiges&rsquo; is, that man is the development of a
monkey, that the monkey is the embryo man, so that <i>if you keep
a baboon long enough</i>, <i>it will develop itself into a
man</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; How well Dr. Cumming has qualified himself
to judge of the ideas in &ldquo;that very unphilosophical
book,&rdquo; as he pronounces it, may be inferred from the fact
that he implies the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; to have
<i>originated</i> the nebular hypothesis.</p>
<p>In the volume from which the last extract is taken, even the
hardihood of assertion is surpassed by the suicidal character of
the argument.&nbsp; It is called &ldquo;The Church before the
Flood,&rdquo; and is devoted chiefly to the adjustment of the
question between the Bible and Geology.&nbsp; Keeping within the
limits we have prescribed to ourselves, we do not enter into the
matter of this discussion; we merely pause a little over the
volume in order to point out Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s mode of treating
the question.&nbsp; He first tells us that &ldquo;the Bible has
not a single scientific error in it;&rdquo; that &ldquo;<i>its
slightest intimations of scientific principles or natural
phenomena have in every instance been demonstrated to be exactly
and strictly true</i>,&rdquo; and he asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How is it that Moses, with no greater
education than the Hindoo or the ancient philosopher, has written
his book, touching science at a thousand points, so accurately
that scientific research has discovered no flaws in it; and yet
in those investigations which have taken place in more recent
centuries, it has not been shown that he has committed one single
error, or made one solitary assertion which can be proved by the
maturest science, or by the most eagle-eyed philosopher, to be
incorrect, scientifically or historically?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>According to this the relation of the Bible to science
should be one of the strong points of apologists for revelation:
the scientific accuracy of Moses should stand at the head of
their evidences; and they might urge with some cogency, that
since Aristotle, who devoted himself to science, and lived many
ages after Moses, does little else than err ingeniously, this
fact, that the Jewish Lawgiver, though touching science at a
thousand points, has written nothing that has not been
&ldquo;demonstrated to be exactly and strictly true,&rdquo; is an
irrefragable proof of his having derived his knowledge from a
supernatural source.&nbsp; How does it happen, then, that Dr.
Cumming forsakes this strong position?&nbsp; How is it that we
find him, some pages further on, engaged in reconciling Genesis
with the discoveries of science, by means of imaginative
hypotheses and feats of &ldquo;interpretation?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Surely, that which has been demonstrated to be exactly and
strictly true does not require hypothesis and critical argument,
in order to show that it may <i>possibly</i> agree with those
very discoveries by means of which its exact and strict truth has
been demonstrated.&nbsp; And why should Dr. Cumming suppose, as
we shall presently find him supposing, that men of science
hesitate to accept the Bible, because it appears to contradict
their discoveries?&nbsp; By his own statement, that appearance of
contradiction does not exist; on the contrary, it has been
demonstrated that the Bible precisely agrees with their
discoveries.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, in saying of the Bible that
its &ldquo;slightest intimations of scientific principles or
natural phenomena have in every instance been demonstrated to be
exactly and strictly true,&rdquo; Dr. Cumming merely means to
imply that theologians have found out a way of explaining the
biblical text so that it no longer, in their opinion, appears to
be in contradiction with the discoveries of science.&nbsp; One of
two things, therefore: either he uses language without the
slightest appreciation of its real meaning, or the assertions he
makes on one page are directly contradicted by the arguments he
urges on another.</p>
<p>Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s principles&mdash;or, we should rather say,
confused <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>notions&mdash;of biblical
interpretation, as exhibited in this volume, are particularly
significant of his mental calibre.&nbsp; He says (&ldquo;Church
before the Flood,&rdquo; p. 93): &ldquo;Men of science, who are
full of scientific investigation and enamored of scientific
discovery, will hesitate before they accept a book which, they
think, contradicts the plainest and the most unequivocal
disclosures they have made in the bowels of the earth, or among
the stars of the sky.&nbsp; To all these we answer, as we have
already indicated, there is not the least dissonance between
God&rsquo;s written book and the most mature discoveries of
geological science.&nbsp; One thing, however, there may be:
<i>there may be a contradiction between the discoveries of
geology and our preconceived interpretations of the
Bible</i>.&nbsp; But this is not because the Bible is wrong, but
because our interpretation is wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The italics in
all cases are our own.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere he says: &ldquo;It seems to me plainly evident that
the record of Genesis, when read fairly, and not in the light of
our prejudices&mdash;<i>and mind you</i>, <i>the essence of
Popery is to read the Bible in the light of our opinions</i>,
<i>instead of viewing our opinions in the light of the Bible</i>,
<i>in its plain and obvious sense</i>&mdash;falls in perfectly
with the assertion of geologists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On comparing these two passages, we gather that when Dr.
Cumming, under stress of geological discovery, assigns to the
biblical text a meaning entirely different from that which, on
his own showing, was universally ascribed to it for more than
three thousand years, he regards himself as &ldquo;viewing his
opinions in the light of the Bible in its plain and obvious
sense!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now he is reduced to one of two alternatives:
either he must hold that the &ldquo;plain and obvious
meaning&rdquo; of the whole Bible differs from age to age, so
that the criterion of its meaning lies in the sum of knowledge
possessed by each successive age&mdash;the Bible being an elastic
garment for the growing thought of mankind; or he must hold that
some portions are amenable to this criterion, and others not
so.&nbsp; In the former case, he accepts the principle of
interpretation adopted by the early German rationalists; in the
latter case he has to show a <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>further
criterion by which we can judge what parts of the Bible are
elastic and what rigid.&nbsp; If he says that the interpretation
of the text is rigid wherever it treats of doctrines necessary to
salvation, we answer, that for doctrines to be necessary to
salvation they must first be true; and in order to be true,
according to his own principle, they must be founded on a correct
interpretation of the biblical text.&nbsp; Thus he makes the
necessity of doctrines to salvation the criterion of infallible
interpretation, and infallible interpretation the criterion of
doctrines being necessary to salvation.&nbsp; He is whirled round
in a circle, having, by admitting the principle of novelty in
interpretation, completely deprived himself of a basis.&nbsp;
That he should seize the very moment in which he is most palpably
betraying that he has no test of biblical truth beyond his own
opinion, as an appropriate occasion for flinging the rather novel
reproach against Popery that its essence is to &ldquo;read the
Bible in the light of our opinions,&rdquo; would be an almost
pathetic self-exposure, if it were not disgusting.&nbsp;
Imbecility that is not even meek, ceases to be pitiable, and
becomes simply odious.</p>
<p>Parenthetic lashes of this kind against Popery are very
frequent with Dr. Cumming, and occur even in his more devout
passages, where their introduction must surely disturb the
spiritual exercises of his hearers.&nbsp; Indeed, Roman Catholics
fare worse with him even than infidels.&nbsp; Infidels are the
small vermin&mdash;the mice to be bagged <i>en passant</i>.&nbsp;
The main object of his chase&mdash;the rats which are to be
nailed up as trophies&mdash;are the Roman Catholics.&nbsp;
Romanism is the masterpiece of Satan; but reassure yourselves!
Dr. Cumming has been created.&nbsp; Antichrist is enthroned in
the Vatican; but he is stoutly withstood by the Boanerges of
Crown-court.&nbsp; The personality of Satan, as might be
expected, is a very prominent tenet in Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s
discourses; those who doubt it are, he thinks, &ldquo;generally
specimens of the victims of Satan as a triumphant seducer;&rdquo;
and it is through the medium of this doctrine that he habitually
contemplates Roman Catholics.&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>They are the
puppets of which the devil holds the strings.&nbsp; It is only
exceptionally that he speaks of them as fellow-men, acted on by
the same desires, fears, and hopes as himself; his <i>rule</i> is
to hold them up to his hearers as foredoomed instruments of Satan
and vessels of wrath.&nbsp; If he is obliged to admit that they
are &ldquo;no shams,&rdquo; that they are &ldquo;thoroughly in
earnest&rdquo;&mdash;that is because they are inspired by hell,
because they are under an &ldquo;infra-natural&rdquo;
influence.&nbsp; If their missionaries are found wherever
Protestant missionaries go, this zeal in propagating their faith
is not in them a consistent virtue, as it is in Protestants, but
a &ldquo;melancholy fact,&rdquo; affording additional evidence
that they are instigated and assisted by the devil.&nbsp; And Dr.
Cumming is inclined to think that they work miracles, because
that is no more than might be expected from the known ability of
Satan who inspires them. <a name="citation86a"></a><a
href="#footnote86a" class="citation">[86a]</a>&nbsp; He admits,
indeed, that &ldquo;there is a fragment of the Church of Christ
in the very bosom of that awful apostasy,&rdquo; <a
name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a> and that there are members of the
Church of Rome in glory; but this admission is rare and
episodical&mdash;is a declaration, <i>pro form&acirc;</i>, about
as influential on the general disposition and habits as an
aristocrat&rsquo;s profession of democracy.</p>
<p>This leads us to mention another conspicuous characteristic of
Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s teaching&mdash;the <i>absence of genuine
charity</i>.&nbsp; It is true that he makes large profession of
tolerance and liberality within a certain circle; he exhorts
Christians to unity; he would have Churchmen fraternize with
Dissenters, and exhorts these two branches of God&rsquo;s family
to defer the settlement of their differences till the
millennium.&nbsp; But the love thus taught is the love of the
<i>clan</i>, which is the correlative of antagonism to the rest
of mankind.&nbsp; It is not sympathy and helpfulness toward men
as men, but toward men as Christians, and as Christians in the
sense of a small minority.&nbsp; Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s religion may
demand a tribute of love, but it gives a charter to hatred; it
may enjoin charity, but it fosters <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>all
uncharitableness.&nbsp; If I believe that God tells me to love my
enemies, but at the same time hates His own enemies and requires
me to have one will with Him, which has the larger scope, love or
hatred?&nbsp; And we refer to those pages of Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s
in which he opposes Roman Catholics, Puseyites, and
infidels&mdash;pages which form the larger proportion of what he
has published&mdash;for proof that the idea of God which both the
logic and spirit of his discourses keep present to his hearers,
is that of a God who hates his enemies, a God who teaches love by
fierce denunciations of wrath&mdash;a God who encourages
obedience to his precepts by elaborately revealing to us that his
own government is in precise opposition to those precepts.&nbsp;
We know the usual evasions on this subject.&nbsp; We know Dr.
Cumming would say that even Roman Catholics are to be loved and
succored as men; that he would help even that &ldquo;unclean
spirit,&rdquo; Cardinal Wiseman, out of a ditch.&nbsp; But who
that is in the slightest degree acquainted with the action of the
human mind will believe that any genuine and large charity can
grow out of an exercise of love which is always to have an
<i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> of hatred?&nbsp; Of what
quality would be the conjugal love of a husband who loved his
spouse as a wife, but hated her as a woman?&nbsp; It is reserved
for the regenerate mind, according to Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s
conception of it, to be &ldquo;wise, amazed, temperate and
furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Precepts of
charity uttered with a faint breath at the end of a sermon are
perfectly futile, when all the force of the lungs has been spent
in keeping the hearer&rsquo;s mind fixed on the conception of his
fellow-men not as fellow-sinners and fellow-sufferers, but as
agents of hell, as automata through whom Satan plays his game
upon earth&mdash;not on objects which call forth their reverence,
their love, their hope of good even in the most strayed and
perverted, but on a minute identification of human things with
such symbols as the scarlet whore, the beast out of the abyss,
scorpions whose sting is in their tails, men who have the mark of
the beast, and unclean spirits like frogs.&nbsp; You might as
well attempt to educate the child&rsquo;s sense <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of beauty by
hanging its nursery with the horrible and grotesque pictures in
which the early painters represented the Last Judgment, as expect
Christian graces to flourish on that prophetic interpretation
which Dr. Cumming offers as the principal nutriment of his
flock.&nbsp; Quite apart from the critical basis of that
interpretation, quite apart from the degree of truth there may be
in Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s prognostications&mdash;questions into
which we do not choose to enter&mdash;his use of prophecy must be
<i>&agrave; priori</i> condemned in the judgment of right-minded
persons, by its results as testified in the net moral effect of
his sermons.&nbsp; The best minds that accept Christianity as a
divinely inspired system, believe that the great end of the
Gospel is not merely the saving but the educating of men&rsquo;s
souls, the creating within them of holy dispositions, the
subduing of egoistical pretensions, and the perpetual enhancing
of the desire that the will of God&mdash;a will synonymous with
goodness and truth&mdash;may be done on earth.&nbsp; But what
relation to all this has a system of interpretation which keeps
the mind of the Christian in the position of a spectator at a
gladiatorial show, of which Satan is the wild beast in the shape
of the great red dragon, and two thirds of mankind the
victims&mdash;the whole provided and got up by God for the
edification of the saints?&nbsp; The demonstration that the
Second Advent is at hand, if true, can have no really holy,
spiritual effect; the highest state of mind inculcated by the
Gospel is resignation to the disposal of God&rsquo;s
providence&mdash;&ldquo;Whether we live, we live unto the Lord;
whether we die, we die unto the Lord&rdquo;&mdash;not an
eagerness to see a temporal manifestation which shall confound
the enemies of God and give exaltation to the saints; it is to
dwell in Christ by spiritual communion with his nature, not to
fix the date when He shall appear in the sky.&nbsp; Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s delight in shadowing forth the downfall of the
Man of Sin, in prognosticating the battle of Gog and Magog, and
in advertising the pre-millennial Advent, is simply the
transportation of political passions on to a so-called religious
platform; it is the anticipation of the triumph of &ldquo;our
party,&rdquo; <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>accomplished by our principal men
being &ldquo;sent for&rdquo; into the clouds.&nbsp; Let us be
understood to speak in all seriousness.&nbsp; If we were in
search of amusement, we should not seek for it by examining Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s works in order to ridicule them.&nbsp; We are
simply discharging a disagreeable duty in delivering our opinion
that, judged by the highest standard even of orthodox
Christianity, they are little calculated to produce&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A closer walk with God,<br />
A calm and heavenly frame;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but are more likely to nourish egoistic complacency and
pretension, a hard and condemnatory spirit toward one&rsquo;s
fellow-men, and a busy occupation with the minuti&aelig; of
events, instead of a reverent contemplation of great facts and a
wise application of great principles.&nbsp; It would be idle to
consider Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s theory of prophecy in any other
light; as a philosophy of history or a specimen of biblical
interpretation, it bears about the same relation to the extension
of genuine knowledge as the astrological &ldquo;house&rdquo; in
the heavens bears to the true structure and relations of the
universe.</p>
<p>The slight degree in which Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s faith is imbued
with truly human sympathies is exhibited in the way he treats the
doctrine of Eternal Punishment.&nbsp; Here a little of that
readiness to strain the letter of the Scriptures which he so
often manifests when his object is to prove a point against
Romanism, would have been an amiable frailty if it had been
applied on the side of mercy.&nbsp; When he is bent on proving
that the prophecy concerning the Man of Sin, in the Second
Epistle to the Thessalonians, refers to the Pope, he can extort
from the innocent word
<i>&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&iota;&sigma;&alpha;&iota;</i> the
meaning <i>cathedrize</i>, though why we are to translate
&ldquo;He as God cathedrizes in the temple of God,&rdquo; any
more than we are to translate &ldquo;cathedrize here, while I go
and pray yonder,&rdquo; it is for Dr. Cumming to show more
clearly than he has yet done.&nbsp; But when rigorous literality
will favor the conclusion that the greater proportion of the
human race will be eternally miserable&mdash;<i>then</i> he is
rigorously literal.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>He says: &ldquo;The Greek words,
<i>&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;</i>,
<i>&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&alpha;&iota;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&omega;&nu;
&alpha;&iota;&omega;&nu;&omega;&nu;</i>, here translated
&lsquo;everlasting,&rsquo; signify literally &lsquo;unto the ages
of ages,&rsquo; &alpha;&iota;&epsilon;&iota; &omega;&nu;,
&lsquo;always being,&rsquo; that is, everlasting, ceaseless
existence.&nbsp; Plato uses the word in this sense when he says,
&lsquo;The gods that live forever.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>But I must
also admit</i> that this word is used several times in a limited
extent&mdash;as for instance, &lsquo;The everlasting
hills.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course this does not mean that there never
will be a time when the hills will cease to stand; the expression
here is evidently figurative, but it implies eternity.&nbsp; The
hills shall remain as long as the earth lasts, and no hand has
power to remove them but that Eternal One which first called them
into being; <i>so the state of the soul</i> remains the same
after death as long as the soul exists, and no one has power to
alter it.&nbsp; The same word is often applied to denote the
existence of God&mdash;&lsquo;the Eternal God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Can
we limit the word when applied to him?&nbsp; Because occasionally
used in a limited sense, we must not infer it is always so.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Everlasting&rsquo; plainly means in Scripture
&lsquo;without end;&rsquo; it is only to be explained
figuratively when it is evident it cannot be interpreted in any
other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not discuss whether Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s interpretation
accords with the meaning of the New Testament writers: we simply
point to the fact that the text becomes elastic for him when he
wants freer play for his prejudices, while he makes it an
adamantine barrier against the admission that mercy will
ultimately triumph&mdash;that God, <i>i.e.</i>, Love, will be all
in all.&nbsp; He assures us that he does not &ldquo;delight to
dwell on the misery of the lost:&rdquo; and we believe him.&nbsp;
That misery does not seem to be a question of feeling with him,
either one way or the other.&nbsp; He does not merely resign
himself to the awful mystery of eternal punishment; he contends
for it.&nbsp; Do we object, he asks, <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a> to everlasting
happiness? then why object to everlasting misery?&mdash;reasoning
which is perhaps felt to be cogent by theologians who anticipate
the everlasting happiness for themselves, and the everlasting
misery for their neighbors.</p>
<p><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>The compassion of some Christians has been glad to take
refuge in the opinion that the Bible allows the supposition of
annihilation for the impenitent; but the rigid sequence of Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s reasoning will not admit of this idea.&nbsp; He
sees that flax is made into linen, and linen into paper; that
paper, when burned, partly ascends as smoke and then again
descends in rain, or in dust and carbon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not one
particle of the original flax is lost, although there may be not
one particle that has not undergone an entire change:
annihilation is not, but change of form is.&nbsp; <i>It will be
thus with our bodies at the resurrection</i>.&nbsp; The death of
the body means not annihilation.&nbsp; <i>Not one feature of the
face</i> will be annihilated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having established the
perpetuity of the body by this close and clear analogy, namely,
that <i>as</i> there is a total change in the particles of flax
in consequence of which they no longer appear as flax, <i>so</i>
there will <i>not</i> be a total change in the particles of the
human body, but they will reappear as the human body, he does not
seem to consider that the perpetuity of the body involves the
perpetuity of the soul, but requires separate evidence for this,
and finds such evidence by begging the very question at
issue&mdash;namely, by asserting that the text of the Scripture
implies &ldquo;the perpetuity of the punishment of the lost, and
the consciousness of the punishment which they
endure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet it is drivelling like this which is
listened to and lauded as eloquence by hundreds, and which a
Doctor of Divinity can believe that he has his &ldquo;reward as a
saint&rdquo; for preaching and publishing!</p>
<p>One more characteristic of Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s writings, and
we have done.&nbsp; This is the <i>perverted moral judgment</i>
that everywhere reigns in them.&nbsp; Not that this perversion is
peculiar to Dr. Cumming: it belongs to the dogmatic system which
he shares with all evangelical believers.&nbsp; But the abstract
tendencies of systems are represented in very different degrees,
according to the different characters of those who embrace them;
just as the same food tells differently on different
constitutions: and there are certain qualities in Dr. <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Cumming that cause the perversion of which we speak to
exhibit itself with peculiar prominence in his teaching.&nbsp; A
single extract will enable us to explain what we mean:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;thoughts&rsquo; are evil.&nbsp;
If it were possible for human eye to discern and to detect the
thoughts that flutter around the heart of an unregenerate
man&mdash;to mark their hue and their multitude, it would be
found that they are indeed &lsquo;evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; We speak not
of the thief, and the murderer, and the adulterer, and such like,
whose crimes draw down the cognizance of earthly tribunals, and
whose unenviable character it is to take the lead in the paths of
sin; but we refer to the men who are marked out by their practice
of many of the seemliest moralities of life&mdash;by the exercise
of the kindliest affections, and the interchange of the sweetest
reciprocities&mdash;and of these men, if unrenewed and unchanged,
we pronounce that their thoughts are evil.&nbsp; To ascertain
this, we must refer to the object around which our thoughts ought
continually to circulate.&nbsp; The Scriptures assert that this
object is <i>the glory of God</i>; that for this we ought to
think, to act, and to speak; and that in thus thinking, acting,
and speaking, there is involved the purest and most endearing
bliss.&nbsp; Now it will be found true of the most amiable men,
that with all their good society and kindliness of heart, and all
their strict and unbending integrity, they never or rarely think
of the glory of God.&nbsp; The question never occurs to
them&mdash;Will this redound to the glory of God?&nbsp; Will this
make his name more known, his being more loved, his praise more
sung?&nbsp; And just inasmuch as their every thought comes short
of this lofty aim, in so much does it come short of good, and
entitle itself to the character of evil.&nbsp; If the glory of
God is not the absorbing and the influential aim of their
thoughts, then they are evil; but God&rsquo;s glory never enters
into their minds.&nbsp; They are amiable, because it chances to
be one of the constitutional tendencies of their individual
character, left uneffaced by the Fall; and <i>they an just and
upright</i>, <i>because they have perhaps no occasion to be
otherwise</i>, <i>or find it subservient to their interests to
maintain such a character</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Occ.
Disc.&rdquo; vol. i. p. 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again we read (Ibid. p. 236):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are traits in the Christian character
which the mere worldly man cannot understand.&nbsp; He can
understand the outward morality, but he cannot understand the
inner spring of it; he can understand Dorcas&rsquo; liberality to
the poor, but he cannot penetrate the ground of Dorcas&rsquo;
liberality.&nbsp; <i>Some men give to the poor because they are
ostentatious</i>, <i>or because they think the poor will
ultimately avenge their </i><!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span><i>neglect</i>; <i>but the Christian gives to the
poor</i>, <i>not only because he has sensibilities like other
men</i>, but because inasmuch as ye did it to the least of these
my brethren ye did it unto me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before entering on the more general question involved in these
quotations, we must point to the clauses we have marked with
italics, where Dr. Cumming appears to express sentiments which,
we are happy to think, are not shared by the majority of his
brethren in the faith.&nbsp; Dr. Cumming, it seems, is unable to
conceive that the natural man can have any other motive for being
just and upright than that it is useless to be otherwise, or that
a character for honesty is profitable; according to his
experience, between the feelings of ostentation and selfish alarm
and the feeling of love to Christ, there lie no sensibilities
which can lead a man to relieve want.&nbsp; Granting, as we
should prefer to think, that it is Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s exposition
of his sentiments which is deficient rather than his sentiments
themselves, still, the fact that the deficiency lies precisely
here, and that he can overlook it not only in the haste of oral
delivery but in the examination of proof-sheets, is strongly
significant of his mental bias&mdash;of the faint degree in which
he sympathizes with the disinterested elements of human feeling,
and of the fact, which we are about to dwell upon, that those
feelings are totally absent from his religious theory.&nbsp; Now,
Dr. Cumming invariably assumes that, in fulminating against those
who differ from him, he is standing on a moral elevation to which
they are compelled reluctantly to look up; that his theory of
motives and conduct is in its loftiness and purity a perpetual
rebuke to their low and vicious desires and practice.&nbsp; It is
time he should be told that the reverse is the fact; that there
are men who do not merely cast a superficial glance at his
doctrine, and fail to see its beauty or justice, but who, after a
close consideration of that doctrine, pronounce it to be
subversive of true moral development, and therefore positively
noxious.&nbsp; Dr. Cumming is fond of showing up the teaching of
Romanism, and accusing it of undermining true morality: it is
time he should be told that <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>there is a
large body, both of thinkers and practical men, who hold
precisely the same opinion of his own teaching&mdash;with this
difference, that they do not regard it as the inspiration of
Satan, but as the natural crop of a human mind where the soil is
chiefly made up of egoistic passions and dogmatic beliefs.</p>
<p>Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s theory, as we have seen, is that actions
are good or evil according as they are prompted or not prompted
by an exclusive reference to the &ldquo;glory of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; God, then, in Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s conception,
is a being who has no pleasure in the exercise of love and
truthfulness and justice, considered as affecting the well-being
of his creatures; He has satisfaction in us only in so far as we
exhaust our motives and dispositions of all relation to our
fellow-beings, and replace sympathy with men by anxiety for the
&ldquo;glory of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deed of Grace Darling, when
she took a boat in the storm to rescue drowning men and women,
was not good if it was only compassion that nerved her arm and
impelled her to brave death for the chance of saving others; it
was only good if she asked herself&mdash;Will this redound to the
glory of God?&nbsp; The man who endures tortures rather than
betray a trust, the man who spends years in toil in order to
discharge an obligation from which the law declares him free,
must be animated not by the spirit of fidelity to his fellow-man,
but by a desire to make &ldquo;the name of God more
known.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sweet charities of domestic
life&mdash;the ready hand and the soothing word in sickness, the
forbearance toward frailties, the prompt helpfulness in all
efforts and sympathy in all joys, are simply evil if they result
from a &ldquo;constitutional tendency,&rdquo; or from
dispositions disciplined by the experience of suffering and the
perception of moral loveliness.&nbsp; A wife is not to devote
herself to her husband out of love to him and a sense of the
duties implied by a close relation&mdash;she is to be a faithful
wife for the glory of God; if she feels her natural affections
welling up too strongly, she is to repress them; it will not do
to act from natural affection&mdash;she must think of the glory
of God.&nbsp; A man is to guide his affairs with energy and
discretion, not from an honest desire to <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>fulfil his
responsibilities as a member of society and a father,
but&mdash;that &ldquo;God&rsquo;s praise may be
sung.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s Christian pays his debts
for the glory of God; were it not for the coercion of that
supreme motive, it would be evil to pay them.&nbsp; A man is not
to be just from a feeling of justice; he is not to help his
fellow-men out of good-will to his fellow-men; he is not to be a
tender husband and father out of affection: all these natural
muscles and fibres are to be torn away and replaced by a patent
steel-spring&mdash;anxiety for the &ldquo;glory of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily, the constitution of human nature forbids the complete
prevalence of such a theory.&nbsp; Fatally powerful as religious
systems have been, human nature is stronger and wider than
religious systems, and though dogmas may hamper, they cannot
absolutely repress its growth: build walls round the living tree
as you will, the bricks and mortar have by and by to give way
before the slow and sure operation of the sap.&nbsp; But next to
the hatred of the enemies of God which is the principle of
persecution, there perhaps has been no perversion more
obstructive of true moral development than this substitution of a
reference to the glory of God for the direct promptings of the
sympathetic feelings.&nbsp; Benevolence and justice are strong
only in proportion as they are directly and inevitably called
into activity by their proper objects; pity is strong only
because we are strongly impressed by suffering; and only in
proportion as it is compassion that speaks through the eyes when
we soothe, and moves the arm when we succor, is a deed strictly
benevolent.&nbsp; If the soothing or the succor be given because
another being wishes or approves it, the deed ceases to be one of
benevolence, and becomes one of deference, of obedience, of
self-interest, or vanity.&nbsp; Accessory motives may aid in
producing an <i>action</i>, but they presuppose the weakness of
the direct motive; and conversely, when the direct motive is
strong, the action of accessory motives will be excluded.&nbsp;
If, then, as Dr. Cumming inculcates, the glory of God is to be
&ldquo;the absorbing and the influential aim&rdquo; in our
thoughts and actions, this must <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>tend to
neutralize the human sympathies; the stream of feeling will be
diverted from its natural current in order to feed an artificial
canal.&nbsp; The idea of God is really moral in its
influence&mdash;it really cherishes all that is best and
loveliest in man&mdash;only when God is contemplated as
sympathizing with the pure elements of human feeling, as
possessing infinitely all those attributes which we recognize to
be moral in humanity.&nbsp; In this light, the idea of God and
the sense of His presence intensify all noble feeling, and
encourage all noble effort, on the same principle that human
sympathy is found a source of strength: the brave man feels
braver when he knows that another stout heart is beating time
with his; the devoted woman who is wearing out her years in
patient effort to alleviate suffering or save vice from the last
stages of degradation, finds aid in the pressure of a friendly
hand which tells her that there is one who understands her deeds,
and in her place would do the like.&nbsp; The idea of a God who
not only sympathizes with all we feel and endure for our
fellow-men, but who will pour new life into our too languid love,
and give firmness to our vacillating purpose, is an extension and
multiplication of the effects produced by human sympathy; and it
has been intensified for the better spirits who have been under
the influence of orthodox Christianity, by the contemplation of
Jesus as &ldquo;God manifest in the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Dr.
Cumming&rsquo;s God is the very opposite of all this: he is a God
who instead of sharing and aiding our human sympathies, is
directly in collision with them; who instead of strengthening the
bond between man and man, by encouraging the sense that they are
both alike the objects of His love and care, thrusts himself
between them and forbids them to feel for each other except as
they have relation to Him.&nbsp; He is a God who, instead of
adding his solar force to swell the tide of those impulses that
tend to give humanity a common life in which the good of one is
the good of all, commands us to check those impulses, lest they
should prevent us from thinking of His glory.&nbsp; It is in vain
for Dr. Cumming to say that we are to love man for God&rsquo;s
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>sake: with the conception of God which his teaching
presents, the love of man for God&rsquo;s sake involves, as his
writings abundantly show, a strong principle of hatred.&nbsp; We
can only love one being for the sake of another when there is an
habitual delight in associating the idea of those two
beings&mdash;that is, when the object of our indirect love is a
source of joy and honor to the object of our direct love; but
according to Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s theory, the majority of
mankind&mdash;the majority of his neighbors&mdash;are in
precisely the opposite relation to God.&nbsp; His soul has no
pleasure in them, they belong more to Satan than to Him, and if
they contribute to His glory, it is against their will.&nbsp; Dr.
Cumming then can only love <i>some</i> men for God&rsquo;s sake;
the rest he must in consistency <i>hate</i> for God&rsquo;s
sake.</p>
<p>There must be many, even in the circle of Dr. Cumming&rsquo;s
admirers, who would be revolted by the doctrine we have just
exposed, if their natural good sense and healthy feeling were not
early stifled by dogmatic beliefs, and their reverence misled by
pious phrases.&nbsp; But as it is, many a rational question, many
a generous instinct, is repelled as the suggestion of a
supernatural enemy, or as the ebullition of human pride and
corruption.&nbsp; This state of inward contradiction can be put
an end to only by the conviction that the free and diligent
exertion of the intellect, instead of being a sin, is part of
their responsibility&mdash;that Right and Reason are
synonymous.&nbsp; The fundamental faith for man is, faith in the
result of a brave, honest, and steady use of all his
faculties:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let knowledge grow from more to more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But more of reverence in us dwell;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That mind and soul according well<br />
May make one music as before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But vaster.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before taking leave of Dr. Cumming, let us express a hope that
we have in no case exaggerated the unfavorable character of the
inferences to be drawn from his pages.&nbsp; His creed often
obliges him to hope the worst of men, and exert himself in
proving that the worst is true; but thus far we are happier <!--
page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>than he.&nbsp; We have no theory which requires us to
attribute unworthy motives to Dr. Cumming, no opinions, religious
or irreligious, which can make it a gratification to us to detect
him in delinquencies.&nbsp; On the contrary, the better we are
able to think of him as a man, while we are obliged to disapprove
him as a theologian, the stronger will be the evidence for our
conviction, that the tendency toward good in human nature has a
force which no creed can utterly counteract, and which insures
the ultimate triumph of that tendency over all dogmatic
perversions.</p>

99</span>IV.&nbsp; GERMAN WIT: HENRY HEINE. <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; says Goethe, &ldquo;is more significant
of men&rsquo;s character than what they find
laughable.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth of this observation would
perhaps have been more apparent if he had said <i>culture</i>
instead of character.&nbsp; The last thing in which the
cultivated man can have community with the vulgar is their
jocularity; and we can hardly exhibit more strikingly the wide
gulf which separates him from them, than by comparing the object
which shakes the diaphragm of a coal-heaver with the highly
complex pleasure derived from a real witticism.&nbsp; That any
high order of wit is exceedingly complex, and demands a ripe and
strong mental development, has one evidence in the fact that we
do not find it in boys at all in proportion to their
manifestation of other powers.&nbsp; Clever boys generally aspire
to the heroic and poetic rather than the comic, and the crudest
of all their efforts are their jokes.&nbsp; Many a witty man will
remember how in his school days a practical joke, more or less
Rabelaisian, was for him the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the
ludicrous.&nbsp; It seems to have been the same with the boyhood
of the human race.&nbsp; The history and literature of the
ancient Hebrews gives the idea of a people who went about their
business and their pleasure as gravely as a society of beavers;
the smile and the laugh are often mentioned metaphorically, but
the smile is one of complacency, the laugh is one of scorn.&nbsp;
Nor can we imagine that the facetious element was very strong in
the <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Egyptians; no laughter lurks in the
wondering eyes and the broad calm lips of their statues.&nbsp;
Still less can the Assyrians have had any genius for the comic:
the round eyes and simpering satisfaction of their ideal faces
belong to a type which is not witty, but the cause of wit in
others.&nbsp; The fun of these early races was, we fancy, of the
after-dinner kind&mdash;loud-throated laughter over the wine-cup,
taken too little account of in sober moments to enter as an
element into their Art, and differing as much from the laughter
of a Chamfort or a Sheridan as the gastronomic enjoyment of an
ancient Briton, whose dinner had no other &ldquo;removes&rdquo;
than from acorns to beech-mast and back again to acorns, differed
from the subtle pleasures of the palate experienced by his
turtle-eating descendant.&nbsp; In fact they had to live
seriously through the stages which to subsequent races were to
become comedy, as those amiable-looking preadamite amphibia which
Professor Owen has restored for us in effigy at Sydenham, took
perfectly <i>au s&eacute;rieux</i> the grotesque physiognomies of
their kindred.&nbsp; Heavy experience in their case, as in every
other, was the base from which the salt of future wit was to be
made.</p>
<p>Humor is of earlier growth than Wit, and it is in accordance
with this earlier growth that it has more affinity with the
poetic tendencies, while Wit is more nearly allied to the
ratiocinative intellect.&nbsp; Humor draws its materials from
situations and characteristics; Wit seizes on unexpected and
complex relations.&nbsp; Humor is chiefly representative and
descriptive; it is diffuse, and flows along without any other law
than its own fantastic will; or it flits about like a
will-of-the-wisp, amazing us by its whimsical transitions.&nbsp;
Wit is brief and sudden, and sharply defined as a crystal; it
does not make pictures, it is not fantastic; but it detects an
unsuspected analogy or suggests a startling or confounding
inference.&nbsp; Every one who has had the opportunity of making
the comparison will remember that the effect produced on him by
some witticisms is closely akin to the effect produced on him by
subtle reasoning which lays open a fallacy or absurdity, and
there are persons whose delight in <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>such
reasoning always manifests itself in laughter.&nbsp; This
affinity of wit with ratiocination is the more obvious in
proportion as the species of wit is higher and deals less with
less words and with superficialities than with the essential
qualities of things.&nbsp; Some of Johnson&rsquo;s most admirable
witticisms consist in the suggestion of an analogy which
immediately exposes the absurdity of an action or proposition;
and it is only their ingenuity, condensation, and
instantaneousness which lift them from reasoning into
Wit&mdash;they are <i>reasoning raised to a higher
power</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand, Humor, in its higher forms,
and in proportion as it associates itself with the sympathetic
emotions, continually passes into poetry: nearly all great modern
humorists may be called prose poets.</p>
<p>Some confusion as to the nature of Humor has been created by
the fact that those who have written most eloquently on it have
dwelt almost exclusively on its higher forms, and have defined
humor in general as the <i>sympathetic</i> presentation of
incongruous elements in human nature and life&mdash;a definition
which only applies to its later development.&nbsp; A great deal
of humor may coexist with a great deal of barbarism, as we see in
the Middle Ages; but the strongest flavor of the humor in such
cases will come, not from sympathy, but more probably from
triumphant egoism or intolerance; at best it will be the love of
the ludicrous exhibiting itself in illustrations of successful
cunning and of the <i>lex talionis</i> as in <i>Reineke
Fuchs</i>, or shaking off in a holiday mood the yoke of a too
exacting faith, as in the old Mysteries.&nbsp; Again, it is
impossible to deny a high degree of humor to many practical
jokes, but no sympathetic nature can enjoy them.&nbsp; Strange as
the genealogy may seem, the original parentage of that wonderful
and delicious mixture of fun, fancy, philosophy, and feeling,
which constitutes modern humor, was probably the cruel mockery of
a savage at the writhings of a suffering enemy&mdash;such is the
tendency of things toward the good and beautiful on this
earth!&nbsp; Probably the reason why high culture demands more
complete harmony with its moral sympathies in humor than in wit,
is <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>that humor is in its nature more prolix&mdash;that it
has not the direct and irresistible force of wit.&nbsp; Wit is an
electric shock, which takes us by violence, quite independently
of our predominant mental disposition; but humor approaches us
more deliberately and leaves us masters of ourselves.&nbsp; Hence
it is, that while coarse and cruel humor has almost disappeared
from contemporary literature, coarse and cruel wit abounds; even
refined men cannot help laughing at a coarse <i>bon mot</i> or a
lacerating personality, if the &ldquo;shock&rdquo; of the
witticism is a powerful one; while mere fun will have no power
over them if it jar on their moral taste.&nbsp; Hence, too, it
is, that while wit is perennial, humor is liable to become
superannuated.</p>
<p>As is usual with definitions and classifications, however,
this distinction between wit and humor does not exactly represent
the actual fact.&nbsp; Like all other species, Wit and Humor
overlap and blend with each other.&nbsp; There are <i>bon
mots</i>, like many of Charles Lamb&rsquo;s, which are a sort of
facetious hybrids, we hardly know whether to call them witty or
humorous; there are rather lengthy descriptions or narratives,
which, like Voltaire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Microm&eacute;gas,&rdquo;
would be more humorous if they were not so sparkling and
antithetic, so pregnant with suggestion and satire, that we are
obliged to call them witty.&nbsp; We rarely find wit untempered
by humor, or humor without a spice of wit; and sometimes we find
them both united in the highest degree in the same mind, as in
Shakespeare and Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; A happy conjunction this,
for wit is apt to be cold, and thin-lipped, and Mephistophelean
in men who have no relish for humor, whose lungs do never crow
like Chanticleer at fun and drollery; and broad-faced, rollicking
humor needs the refining influence of wit.&nbsp; Indeed, it may
be said that there is no really fine writing in which wit has not
an implicit, if not an explicit, action.&nbsp; The wit may never
rise to the surface, it may never flame out into a witticism; but
it helps to give brightness and transparency, it warns off from
flights and exaggerations which verge on the ridiculous&mdash;in
every <i>genre</i> of writing it preserves a man from sinking
into the <i>genre ennuyeux</i>.&nbsp; And it is eminently <!--
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>needed for this office in humorous writing; for as
humor has no limits imposed on it by its material, no law but its
own exuberance, it is apt to become preposterous and wearisome
unless checked by wit, which is the enemy of all monotony, of all
lengthiness, of all exaggeration.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nearest approach Nature has given us to a complete
analysis, in which wit is as thoroughly exhausted of humor as
possible, and humor as bare as possible of wit, is in the typical
Frenchman and the typical German.&nbsp; Voltaire, the intensest
example of pure wit, fails in most of his fictions from his lack
of humor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Microm&eacute;gas&rdquo; is a perfect
tale, because, as it deals chiefly with philosophic ideas and
does not touch the marrow of human feeling and life, the
writer&rsquo;s wit and wisdom were all-sufficient for his
purpose.&nbsp; Not so with &ldquo;Candide.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
Voltaire had to give pictures of life as well as to convey
philosophic truth and satire, and here we feel the want of
humor.&nbsp; The sense of the ludicrous is continually defeated
by disgust, and the scenes, instead of presenting us with an
amusing or agreeable picture, are only the frame for a
witticism.&nbsp; On the other hand, German humor generally shows
no sense of measure, no instinctive tact; it is either
floundering and clumsy as the antics of a leviathan, or laborious
and interminable as a Lapland day, in which one loses all hope
that the stars and quiet will ever come.&nbsp; For this reason,
Jean Paul, the greatest of German humorists, is unendurable to
many readers, and frequently tiresome to all.&nbsp; Here, as
elsewhere, the German shows the absence of that delicate
perception, that sensibility to gradation, which is the essence
of tact and taste, and the necessary concomitant of wit.&nbsp;
All his subtlety is reserved for the region of metaphysics.&nbsp;
For <i>Identit&auml;t</i> in the abstract no one can have an
acuter vision, but in the concrete he is satisfied with a very
loose approximation.&nbsp; He has the finest nose for
<i>Empirismus</i> in philosophical doctrine, but the presence of
more or less tobacco smoke in the air he breathes is
imperceptible to him.&nbsp; To the typical German&mdash;<i>Vetter
Michel</i>&mdash;it is indifferent whether his door-lock will
catch, whether his teacup be more <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>or less
than an inch thick; whether or not his book have every other leaf
unstitched; whether his neighbor&rsquo;s conversation be more or
less of a shout; whether he pronounce <i>b</i> or <i>p</i>,
<i>t</i> or <i>d</i>; whether or not his adored one&rsquo;s teeth
be few and far between.&nbsp; He has the same sort of
insensibility to gradations in time.&nbsp; A German comedy is
like a German sentence: you see no reason in its structure why it
should ever come to an end, and you accept the conclusion as an
arrangement of Providence rather than of the author.&nbsp; We
have heard Germans use the word <i>Langeweile</i>, the equivalent
for ennui, and we have secretly wondered <i>what</i> it can be
that produces ennui in a German.&nbsp; Not the longest of long
tragedies, for we have known him to pronounce that <i>h&ouml;chst
fesselnd</i> (<i>so</i> enchaining!); not the heaviest of heavy
books, for he delights in that as <i>gr&uuml;ndlich</i> (deep,
Sir, deep!); not the slowest of journeys in a <i>Postwagen</i>,
for the slower the horses, the more cigars he can smoke before he
reaches his journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; German ennui must be
something as superlative as Barclay&rsquo;s treble X, which, we
suppose, implies an extremely unknown quantity of
stupefaction.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that this national deficiency in nicety of
perception must have its effect on the national appreciation and
exhibition of Humor.&nbsp; You find in Germany ardent admirers of
Shakespeare, who tell you that what they think most admirable in
him is his <i>Wortspiel</i>, his verbal quibbles; and one of
these, a man of no slight culture and refinement, once cited to a
friend of ours Proteus&rsquo;s joke in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen
of Verona&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nod I? why that&rsquo;s
Noddy,&rdquo; as a transcendant specimen of Shakespearian
wit.&nbsp; German facetiousness is seldom comic to foreigners,
and an Englishman with a swelled cheek might take up
<i>Kladderadatsch</i>, the German Punch, without any danger of
agitating his facial muscles.&nbsp; Indeed, it is a remarkable
fact that, among the five great races concerned in modern
civilization, the German race is the only one which, up to the
present century, had contributed nothing classic to the common
stock of European wit and humor; for <i>Reineke Fuchs</i> cannot
be regarded as a peculiarly Teutonic <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>product.&nbsp; Italy was the birthplace of Pantomime
and the immortal Pulcinello; Spain had produced Cervantes; France
had produced Rabelais and Moli&egrave;re, and classic wits
innumerable; England had yielded Shakspeare and a host of
humorists.&nbsp; But Germany had borne no great comic dramatist,
no great satirist, and she has not yet repaired the omission; she
had not even produced any humorist of a high order.&nbsp; Among
her great writers, Lessing is the one who is the most
specifically witty.&nbsp; We feel the implicit influence of
wit&mdash;the &ldquo;flavor of mind&rdquo;&mdash;throughout his
writings; and it is often concentrated into pungent satire, as
every reader of the <i>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</i>
remembers.&nbsp; Still Lessing&rsquo;s name has not become
European through his wit, and his charming comedy, <i>Minna von
Barnhelm</i>, has won no place on a foreign stage.&nbsp; Of
course we do not pretend to an exhaustive acquaintance with
German literature; we not only admit&mdash;we are sure that it
includes much comic writing of which we know nothing.&nbsp; We
simply state the fact, that no German production of that kind,
before the present century, ranked as European; a fact which does
not, indeed, determine the <i>amount</i> of the national
facetiousness, but which is quite decisive as to its
<i>quality</i>.&nbsp; Whatever may be the stock of fun which
Germany yields for home consumption, she has provided little for
the palate of other lands.&nbsp; All honor to her for the still
greater things she has done for us!&nbsp; She has fought the
hardest fight for freedom of thought, has produced the grandest
inventions, has made magnificent contributions to science, has
given us some of the divinest poetry, and quite the divinest
music in the world.&nbsp; No one reveres and treasures the
products of the German mind more than we do.&nbsp; To say that
that mind is not fertile in wit is only like saying that
excellent wheat land is not rich pasture; to say that we do not
enjoy German facetiousness is no more than to say that, though
the horse is the finest of quadrupeds, we do not like him to lay
his hoof playfully on our shoulder.&nbsp; Still, as we have
noticed that the pointless puns and stupid jocularity of the boy
may ultimately be developed into the epigrammatic <!-- page
106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>brilliancy and polished playfulness of the man; as we
believe that racy wit and chastened delicate humor are inevitably
the results of invigorated and refined mental activity, we can
also believe that Germany will, one day, yield a crop of wits and
humorists.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is already an earnest of that future crop in the
existence of Heinrich Heine, a German born with the present
century, who, to Teutonic imagination, sensibility, and humor,
adds an amount of <i>esprit</i> that would make him brilliant
among the most brilliant of Frenchmen.&nbsp; True, this unique
German wit is half a Hebrew; but he and his ancestors spent their
youth in German air, and were reared on <i>Wurst</i> and
<i>Sauerkraut</i>, so that he is as much a German as a pheasant
is an English bird, or a potato an Irish vegetable.&nbsp; But
whatever else he may be, Heine is one of the most remarkable men
of this age: no echo, but a real voice, and therefore, like all
genuine things in this world, worth studying; a surpassing lyric
poet, who has uttered our feelings for us in delicious song; a
humorist, who touches leaden folly with the magic wand of his
fancy, and transmutes it into the fine gold of art&mdash;who
sheds his sunny smile on human tears, and makes them a beauteous
rainbow on the cloudy background of life; a wit, who holds in his
mighty hand the most scorching lightnings of satire; an artist in
prose literature, who has shown even more completely than Goethe
the possibilities of German prose; and&mdash;in spite of all
charges against him, true as well as false&mdash;a lover of
freedom, who has spoken wise and brave words on behalf of his
fellow-men.&nbsp; He is, moreover, a suffering man, who, with all
the highly-wrought sensibility of genius, has to endure terrible
physical ills; and as such he calls forth more than an
intellectual interest.&nbsp; It is true, alas! that there is a
heavy weight in the other scale&mdash;that Heine&rsquo;s
magnificent powers have often served only to give electric force
to the expression of debased feeling, so that his works are no
Phidian statue of gold, and ivory, and gems, but have not a
little brass, and iron, and miry clay mingled with the precious
metal.&nbsp; The audacity of his occasional coarseness <!-- page
107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>and personality is unparalleled in contemporary
literature, and has hardly been exceeded by the license of former
days.&nbsp; Hence, before his volumes are put within the reach of
immature minds, there is need of a friendly penknife to exercise
a strict censorship.&nbsp; Yet, when all coarseness, all
scurrility, all Mephistophelean contempt for the reverent
feelings of other men, is removed, there will be a plenteous
remainder of exquisite poetry, of wit, humor, and just
thought.&nbsp; It is apparently too often a congenial task to
write severe words about the transgressions committed by men of
genius, especially when the censor has the advantage of being
himself a man of <i>no</i> genius, so that those transgressions
seem to him quite gratuitous; <i>he</i>, forsooth, never
lacerated any one by his wit, or gave irresistible piquancy to a
coarse allusion, and his indignation is not mitigated by any
knowledge of the temptation that lies in transcendent
power.&nbsp; We are also apt to measure what a gifted man has
done by our arbitrary conception of what he might have done,
rather than by a comparison of his actual doings with our own or
those of other ordinary men.&nbsp; We make ourselves overzealous
agents of heaven, and demand that our brother should bring
usurious interest for his five Talents, forgetting that it is
less easy to manage five Talents than two.&nbsp; Whatever benefit
there may be in denouncing the evil, it is after all more
edifying, and certainly more cheering, to appreciate the
good.&nbsp; Hence, in endeavoring to give our readers some
account of Heine and his works, we shall not dwell lengthily on
his failings; we shall not hold the candle up to dusty,
vermin-haunted corners, but let the light fall as much as
possible on the nobler and more attractive details.&nbsp; Our
sketch of Heine&rsquo;s life, which has been drawn from various
sources, will be free from everything like intrusive gossip, and
will derive its coloring chiefly from the autobiographical hints
and descriptions scattered through his own writings.&nbsp; Those
of our readers who happen to know nothing of Heine will in this
way be making their acquaintance with the writer while they are
learning the outline of his career.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>We have said that Heine was born with the present
century; but this statement is not precise, for we learn that,
according to his certificate of baptism, he was born December
12th, 1799.&nbsp; However, as he himself says, the important
point is that he was born, and born on the banks of the Rhine, at
D&uuml;sseldorf, where his father was a merchant.&nbsp; In his
&ldquo;Reisebilder&rdquo; he gives us some recollections, in his
wild poetic way, of the dear old town where he spent his
childhood, and of his schoolboy troubles there.&nbsp; We shall
quote from these in butterfly fashion, sipping a little nectar
here and there, without regard to any strict order:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I first saw the light on the banks of that
lovely stream, where Folly grows on the green hills, and in
autumn is plucked, pressed, poured into casks, and sent into
foreign lands.&nbsp; Believe me, I yesterday heard some one utter
folly which, in anno 1811, lay in a bunch of grapes I then saw
growing on the Johannisberg. . . . Mon Dieu! if I had only such
faith in me that I could remove mountains, the Johannisberg would
be the very mountain I should send for wherever I might be; but
as my faith is not so strong, imagination must help me, and it
transports me at once to the lovely Rhine. . . . I am again a
child, and playing with other children on the Schlossplatz, at
D&uuml;sseldorf on the Rhine.&nbsp; Yes, madam, there was I born;
and I note this expressly, in case, after my death, seven
cities&mdash;Schilda, Kr&auml;hwinkel, Polkwitz, Bockum,
D&uuml;lken, G&ouml;ttingen, and
Sch&ouml;ppenst&auml;dt&mdash;should contend for the honor of
being my birthplace.&nbsp; D&uuml;sseldorf is a town on the
Rhine; sixteen thousand men live there, and many hundred thousand
men besides lie buried there. . . . . Among them, many of whom my
mother says, that it would be better if they were still living;
for example, my grandfather and my uncle, the old Herr von
Geldern and the young Herr von Geldern, both such celebrated
doctors, who saved so many men from death, and yet must die
themselves.&nbsp; And the pious Ursula, who carried me in her
arms when I was a child, also lies buried there and a rosebush
grows on her grave; she loved the scent of roses so well in life,
and her heart was pure rose-incense and goodness.&nbsp; The
knowing old Canon, too, lies buried there.&nbsp; Heavens, what an
object he looked when I last saw him!&nbsp; <i>He was made up of
nothing but mind and plasters</i>, and nevertheless studied day
and night, as if he were alarmed lest the worms should find an
idea too little in his head.&nbsp; And the little William lies
there, and for this I am to <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>blame.&nbsp; We were schoolfellows in the Franciscan
monastery, and were playing on that side of it where the
D&uuml;ssel flows between stone walls, and I said,
&lsquo;William, fetch out the kitten that has just fallen
in&rsquo;&mdash;and merrily he went down on to the plank which
lay across the brook, snatched the kitten out of the water, but
fell in himself, and was dragged out dripping and dead.&nbsp;
<i>The kitten lived to a good old age</i>. . . . Princes in that
day were not the tormented race as they are now; the crown grew
firmly on their heads, and at night they drew a nightcap over it,
and slept peacefully, and peacefully slept the people at their
feet; and when the people waked in the morning, they said,
&lsquo;Good morning, father!&rsquo; and the princes answered,
&lsquo;Good morning, dear children!&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was
suddenly quite otherwise; for when we awoke one morning at
D&uuml;sseldorf, and were ready to say, &lsquo;Good morning,
father!&rsquo; lo! the father was gone away; and in the whole
town there was nothing but dumb sorrow, everywhere a sort of
funeral disposition; and people glided along silently to the
market, and read the long placard placed on the door of the Town
Hall.&nbsp; It was dismal weather; yet the lean tailor, Kilian,
stood in his nankeen jacket which he usually wore only in the
house, and his blue worsted stockings hung down so that his naked
legs peeped out mournfully, and his thin lips trembled while he
muttered the announcement to himself.&nbsp; And an old soldier
read rather louder, and at many a word a crystal tear trickled
down to his brave old mustache.&nbsp; I stood near him and wept
in company, and asked him, &lsquo;<i>Why we
wept</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered, &lsquo;The Elector has
abdicated.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he read again, and at the words,
&lsquo;for the long-manifested fidelity of my subjects,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;hereby set you free from your allegiance,&rsquo; he
wept more than ever.&nbsp; It is strangely touching to see an old
man like that, with faded uniform and scarred face, weep so
bitterly all of a sudden.&nbsp; While we were reading, the
electoral arms were taken down from the Town Hall; everything had
such a desolate air, that it was as if an eclipse of the sun were
expected. . . . I went home and wept, and wailed out, &lsquo;The
Elector has abdicated!&rsquo;&nbsp; In vain my mother took a
world of trouble to explain the thing to me.&nbsp; I knew what I
knew; I was not to be persuaded, but went crying to bed, and in
the night dreamed that the world was at an end.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next morning, however, the sun rises as usual, and Joachim
Murat is proclaimed Grand Duke, whereupon there is a holiday at
the public school, and Heinrich (or Harry, for that was his
baptismal name, which he afterward had the <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>good taste
to change), perched on the bronze horse of the Electoral statue,
sees quite a different scene from yesterday&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The next day the world was again all in
order, and we had school as before, and things were got by heart
as before&mdash;the Roman emperors, chronology, the nouns in
<i>im</i>, the <i>verba irregularia</i>, Greek, Hebrew,
geography, mental arithmetic!&mdash;heavens! my head is still
dizzy with it&mdash;all must be learned by heart!&nbsp; And a
great deal of this came very conveniently for me in after
life.&nbsp; For if I had not known the Roman kings by heart, it
would subsequently have been quite indifferent to me whether
Niebuhr had proved or had not proved that they never really
existed. . . . But oh! the trouble I had at school with the
endless dates.&nbsp; And with arithmetic it was still
worse.&nbsp; What I understood best was subtraction, for that has
a very practical rule: &lsquo;Four can&rsquo;t be taken from
three, therefore I must borrow one.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I advise
every one in such a case to borrow a few extra pence, for no one
can tell what may happen. . . . As for Latin, you have no idea,
madam, what a complicated affair it is.&nbsp; The Romans would
never have found time to conquer the world if they had first had
to learn Latin.&nbsp; Luckily for them, they already knew in
their cradles what nouns have their accusative in
<i>im</i>.&nbsp; I, on the contrary, had to learn them by heart
in the sweat of my brow; nevertheless, it is fortunate for me
that I know them . . . and the fact that I have them at my
finger-ends if I should ever happen to want them suddenly,
affords me much inward repose and consolation in many troubled
hours of life. . . . Of Greek I will not say a word, I should get
too much irritated.&nbsp; The monks in the Middle Ages were not
so far wrong when they maintained that Greek was an invention of
the devil.&nbsp; God knows the suffering I endured over it. . . .
With Hebrew it went somewhat better, for I had always a great
liking for the Jews, though to this very hour they crucify my
good name; but I could never get on so far in Hebrew as my watch,
which had much familiar intercourse with pawnbrokers, and in this
way contracted many Jewish habits&mdash;for example, it
wouldn&rsquo;t go on Saturdays.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heine&rsquo;s parents were apparently not wealthy, but his
education was cared for by his uncle, Solomon Heine, a great
banker in Hamburg, so that he had no early pecuniary
disadvantages to struggle with.&nbsp; He seems to have been very
happy in his mother, who was not of Hebrew but of Teutonic blood;
he often mentions her with reverence and affection, and in the
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;Buch der Lieder&rdquo; there are two exquisite
sonnets addressed to her, which tell how his proud spirit was
always subdued by the charm of her presence, and how her love was
the home of his heart after restless weary ramblings:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wie m&auml;chtig auch mein stolzer Muth
sich bl&auml;he,<br />
In deiner selig s&uuml;ssen, trauten Nahe<br />
Ergreift mich oft ein demuthvolles Zagen.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Und immer irrte ich naeh Liebe, immer<br />
Nach Liebe, doch die Liebe fand ich nimmer,<br />
Und kehrte um nach Hause, krank und tr&uuml;be.<br />
Doch da bist du entgegen mir gekommen,<br />
Und ach! was da in deinem Aug&rsquo; geschwommen,<br />
Das war die s&uuml;sse, langgesuchte Liebe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was at first destined for a mercantile life, but Nature
declared too strongly against this plan.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
knows,&rdquo; he has lately said in conversation with his
brother, &ldquo;I would willingly have become a banker, but I
could never bring myself to that pass.&nbsp; I very early
discerned that bankers would one day be the rulers of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; So commerce was at length given up for law,
the study of which he began in 1819 at the University of
Bonn.&nbsp; He had already published some poems in the corner of
a newspaper, and among them was one on Napoleon, the object of
his youthful enthusiasm.&nbsp; This poem, he says in a letter to
St. R&eacute;n&eacute; Taillandier, was written when he was only
sixteen.&nbsp; It is still to be found in the &ldquo;Buch der
Lieder&rdquo; under the title &ldquo;Die Grenadiere,&rdquo; and
it proves that even in its earliest efforts his genius showed a
strongly specific character.</p>
<p>It will be easily imagined that the germs of poetry sprouted
too vigorously in Heine&rsquo;s brain for jurisprudence to find
much room there.&nbsp; Lectures on history and literature, we are
told, were more diligently attended than lectures on law.&nbsp;
He had taken care, too, to furnish his trunk with abundant
editions of the poets, and the poet he especially studied at that
time was Byron.&nbsp; At a later period, we find his taste taking
another direction, for he writes, &ldquo;Of all authors, Byron is
precisely <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the one who excites in me the most
intolerable emotion; whereas Scott, in every one of his works,
gladdens my heart, soothes, and invigorates me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another indication of his bent in these Bonn days was a newspaper
essay, in which he attacked the Romantic school; and here also he
went through that chicken-pox of authorship&mdash;the production
of a tragedy.&nbsp; Heine&rsquo;s
tragedy&mdash;<i>Almansor</i>&mdash;is, as might be expected,
better than the majority of these youthful mistakes.&nbsp; The
tragic collision lies in the conflict between natural affection
and the deadly hatred of religion and of race&mdash;in the
sacrifice of youthful lovers to the strife between Moor and
Spaniard, Moslem and Christian.&nbsp; Some of the situations are
striking, and there are passages of considerable poetic merit;
but the characters are little more than shadowy vehicles for the
poetry, and there is a want of clearness and probability in the
structure.&nbsp; It was published two years later, in company
with another tragedy, in one act, called <i>William
Ratcliffe</i>, in which there is rather a feeble use of the
Scotch second-sight after the manner of the Fate in the Greek
tragedy.&nbsp; We smile to find Heine saying of his tragedies, in
a letter to a friend soon after their publication: &ldquo;I know
they will be terribly cut up, but I will confess to you in
confidence that they are very good, better than my collection of
poems, which are not worth a shot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere he
tells us, that when, after one of Paganini&rsquo;s concerts, he
was passionately complimenting the great master on his
violin-playing.&nbsp; Paganini interrupted him thus: &ldquo;But
how were you pleased with my <i>bows</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1820 Heine left Bonn for G&ouml;ttingen.&nbsp; He there
pursued his omission of law studies, and at the end of three
months he was rusticated for a breach of the laws against
duelling.&nbsp; While there, he had attempted a negotiation with
Brockhaus for the printing of a volume of poems, and had endured
the first ordeal of lovers and poets&mdash;a refusal.&nbsp; It
was not until a year after that he found a Berlin publisher for
his first volume of poems, subsequently transformed, with
additions, into the &ldquo;Buch der Lieder.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
remained between two and three <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>years at
Berlin, and the society he found there seems to have made these
years an important epoch in his culture.&nbsp; He was one of the
youngest members of a circle which assembled at the house of the
poetess Elise von Hohenhausen, the translator of Byron&mdash;a
circle which included Chamisso, Varnhagen, and Rahel
(Varnhagen&rsquo;s wife).&nbsp; For Rahel, Heine had a profound
admiration and regard; he afterward dedicated to her the poems
included under the tide &ldquo;Heimkehr;&rdquo; and he frequently
refers to her or quotes her in a way that indicates how he valued
her influence.&nbsp; According to his friend F. von Hohenhausen,
the opinions concerning Heine&rsquo;s talent were very various
among his Berlin friends, and it was only a small minority that
had any presentiment of his future fame.&nbsp; In this minority
was Elise von Hohenhausen, who proclaimed Heine as the Byron of
Germany; but her opinion was met with much head-shaking and
opposition.&nbsp; We can imagine how precious was such a
recognition as hers to the young poet, then only two or three and
twenty, and with by no means an impressive personality for
superficial eyes.&nbsp; Perhaps even the deep-sighted were far
from detecting in that small, blonde, pale young man, with quiet,
gentle manners, the latent powers of ridicule and
sarcasm&mdash;the terrible talons that were one day to be thrust
out from the velvet paw of the young leopard.</p>
<p>It was apparently during this residence in Berlin that Heine
united himself with the Lutheran Church.&nbsp; He would
willingly, like many of his friends, he tells us, have remained
free from all ecclesiastical ties if the authorities there had
not forbidden residence in Prussia, and especially in Berlin, to
every one who did not belong to one of the positive religions
recognized by the State.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As Henry IV. once laughingly said,
&lsquo;<i>Paris vaut bien une messe</i>,&rsquo; so I might with
reason say, &lsquo;<i>Berlin vaut bien une
pr&ecirc;che</i>;&rsquo; and I could afterward, as before,
accommodate myself to the very enlightened Christianity,
filtrated from all superstition, which could then be had in the
churches of Berlin, and which was even free from the divinity of
Christ, like turtle-soup without turtle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>At the same period, too, Heine became acquainted with
Hegel.&nbsp; In his lately published
&ldquo;Gest&auml;ndnisse&rdquo; (Confessions) he throws on
Hegel&rsquo;s influence over him the blue light of demoniacal
wit, and confounds us by the most bewildering double-edged
sarcasms; but that influence seems to have been at least more
wholesome than the one which produced the mocking retractations
of the &ldquo;Gest&auml;ndnisse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through all his
self-satire, we discern that in those days he had something like
real earnestness and enthusiasm, which are certainly not apparent
in his present theistic confession of faith.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the whole, I never felt a strong
enthusiasm for this philosophy, and conviction on the subject was
out of question.&nbsp; I never was an abstract thinker, and I
accepted the synthesis of the Hegelian doctrine without demanding
any proof; since its consequences flattered my vanity.&nbsp; I
was young and proud, and it pleased my vainglory when I learned
from Hegel that the true God was not, as my grandmother believed,
the God who lives in heaven, but myself here upon earth.&nbsp;
This foolish pride had not in the least a pernicious influence on
my feelings; on the contrary, it heightened these to the pitch of
heroism.&nbsp; I was at that time so lavish in generosity and
self-sacrifice that I must assuredly have eclipsed the most
brilliant deeds of those good <i>bourgeois</i> of virtue who
acted merely from a sense of duty, and simply obeyed the laws of
morality.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His sketch of Hegel is irresistibly amusing; but we must warn
the reader that Heine&rsquo;s anecdotes are often mere devices of
style by which he conveys his satire or opinions.&nbsp; The
reader will see that he does not neglect an opportunity of giving
a sarcastic lash or two, in passing, to Meyerbeer, for whose
music he has a great contempt.&nbsp; The sarcasm conveyed in the
substitution of <i>reputation</i> for <i>music</i> and
<i>journalists</i> for <i>musicians</i>, might perhaps escape any
one unfamiliar with the sly and unexpected turns of Heine&rsquo;s
ridicule.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To speak frankly, I seldom understood him,
and only arrived at the meaning of his words by subsequent
reflection.&nbsp; I believe he wished not to be understood; and
hence his practice of sprinkling his discourse with modifying
parentheses; hence, perhaps, his preference for persons of whom
he knew that they did not understand <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>him, and to
whom he all the more willingly granted the honor of his familiar
acquaintance.&nbsp; Thus every one in Berlin wondered at the
intimate companionship of the profound Hegel with the late
Heinrich Beer, a brother of Giacomo Meyerbeer, who is universally
known by his reputation, and who has been celebrated by the
cleverest journalists.&nbsp; This Beer, namely Heinrich, was a
thoroughly stupid fellow, and indeed was afterward actually
declared imbecile by his family, and placed under guardianship,
because instead of making a name for himself in art or in science
by means of his great fortune, he squandered his money on
childish trifles; and, for example, one day bought six thousand
thalers&rsquo; worth of walking-sticks.&nbsp; This poor man, who
had no wish to pass either for a great tragic dramatist, or for a
great star-gazer, or for a laurel-crowned musical genius, a rival
of Mozart and Rossini, and preferred giving his money for
walking-sticks&mdash;this degenerate Beer enjoyed Hegel&rsquo;s
most confidential society; he was the philosopher&rsquo;s bosom
friend, his Pylades, and accompanied him everywhere like his
shadow.&nbsp; The equally witty and gifted Felix Mendelssohn once
sought to explain this phenomenon, by maintaining that Hegel did
not understand Heinrich Beer.&nbsp; I now believe, however, that
the real ground of that intimacy consisted in this&mdash;Hegel
was convinced that no word of what he said was understood by
Heinrich Beer; and he could therefore, in his presence, give
himself up to all the intellectual outpourings of the
moment.&nbsp; In general, Hegel&rsquo;s conversation was a sort
of monologue, sighed forth by starts in a noiseless voice; the
odd roughness of his expressions often struck me, and many of
them have remained in my memory.&nbsp; One beautiful starlight
evening we stood together at the window, and I, a young man of
one-and-twenty, having just had a good dinner and finished my
coffee, spoke with enthusiasm of the stars, and called them the
habitations of the departed.&nbsp; But the master muttered to
himself, &lsquo;The stars! hum! hum!&nbsp; The stars are only a
brilliant leprosy on the face of the heavens.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;is there,
then, no happy place above, where virtue is rewarded after
death?&rsquo;&nbsp; But he, staring at me with his pale eyes,
said, cuttingly, &lsquo;So you want a bonus for having taken care
of your sick mother, and refrained from poisoning your worthy
brother?&rsquo;&nbsp; At these words he looked anxiously round,
but appeared immediately set at rest when he observed that it was
only Heinrich Beer, who had approached to invite him to a game at
whist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1823 Heine returned to G&ouml;ttingen to complete his
career as a law-student, and this time he gave evidence of
advanced <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>mental maturity, not only by
producing many of the charming poems subsequently included in the
&ldquo;Reisebilder,&rdquo; but also by prosecuting his
professional studies diligently enough to leave G&ouml;ttingen,
in 1825, as <i>Doctor juris</i>.&nbsp; Hereupon he settled at
Hamburg as an advocate, but his profession seems to have been the
least pressing of his occupations.&nbsp; In those days a small
blonde young man, with the brim of his hat drawn over his nose,
his coat flying open, and his hands stuck in his trousers
pockets, might be seen stumbling along the streets of Hamburg,
staring from side to side, and appearing to have small regard to
the figure he made in the eyes of the good citizens.&nbsp;
Occasionally an inhabitant more literary than usual would point
out this young man to his companion as <i>Heinrich Heine</i>; but
in general the young poet had not to endure the inconveniences of
being a lion.&nbsp; His poems were devoured, but he was not asked
to devour flattery in return.&nbsp; Whether because the fair
Hamburgers acted in the spirit of Johnson&rsquo;s advice to
Hannah More&mdash;to &ldquo;consider what her flattery was worth
before she choked him with it&rdquo;&mdash;or for some other
reason, Heine, according to the testimony of August Lewald, to
whom we owe these particulars of his Hamburg life, was left free
from the persecution of tea-parties.&nbsp; Not, however, from
another persecution of Genius&mdash;nervous headaches, which some
persons, we are told, regarded as an improbable fiction, intended
as a pretext for raising a delicate white hand to his
forehead.&nbsp; It is probable that the sceptical persons alluded
to were themselves untroubled with nervous headaches, and that
their hands were <i>not</i> delicate.&nbsp; Slight details,
these, but worth telling about a man of genius, because they help
us to keep in mind that he is, after all, our brother, having to
endure the petty every-day ills of life as we have; with this
difference, that his heightened sensibility converts what are
mere insect stings for us into scorpion stings for him.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, in these Hamburg days that Heine paid the
visit to Goethe, of which he gives us this charming little
picture:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>&ldquo;When I visited him in Weimar,
and stood before him, I involuntarily glanced at his side to see
whether the eagle was not there with the lightning in his
beak.&nbsp; I was nearly speaking Greek to him; but, as I
observed that he understood German, I stated to him in German
that the plums on the road between Jena and Weimar were very
good.&nbsp; I had for so many long winter nights thought over
what lofty and profound things I would say to Goethe, if ever I
saw him.&nbsp; And when I saw him at last, I said to him, that
the Saxon plums were very good!&nbsp; And Goethe
smiled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the next few years Heine produced the most popular of
all his works&mdash;those which have won him his place as the
greatest of living German poets and humorists.&nbsp; Between 1826
and 1829 appeared the four volumes of the
&ldquo;Reisebilder&rdquo; (Pictures of Travel) and the
&ldquo;Buch der Lieder&rdquo; (Book of Songs), a volume of
lyrics, of which it is hard to say whether their greatest charm
is the lightness and finish of their style, their vivid and
original imaginativeness, or their simple, pure
sensibility.&nbsp; In his &ldquo;Reisebilder&rdquo; Heine carries
us with him to the Hartz, to the isle of Norderney, to his native
town D&uuml;sseldorf, to Italy, and to England, sketching scenery
and character, now with the wildest, most fantastic humor, now
with the finest idyllic sensibility&mdash;letting his thoughts
wander from poetry to politics, from criticism to dreamy reverie,
and blending fun, imagination, reflection, and satire in a sort
of exquisite, ever-varying shimmer, like the hues of the
opal.</p>
<p>Heine&rsquo;s journey to England did not at all heighten his
regard for the English.&nbsp; He calls our language the
&ldquo;hiss of egoism (<i>Zischlaute des Egoismus</i>); and his
ridicule of English awkwardness is as merciless as&mdash;English
ridicule of German awkwardness.&nbsp; His antipathy toward us
seems to have grown in intensity, like many of his other
antipathies; and in his &ldquo;Vermischte Schriften&rdquo; he is
more bitter than ever.&nbsp; Let us quote one of his philippics,
since bitters are understood to be wholesome:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is certainly a frightful injustice to
pronounce sentence of condemnation on an entire people.&nbsp; But
with regard to the English, momentary disgust might betray me
into this injustice; and on <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>looking at
the mass I easily forget the many brave and noble men who
distinguished themselves by intellect and love of freedom.&nbsp;
But these, especially the British poets, were always all the more
glaringly in contrast with the rest of the nation; they were
isolated martyrs to their national relations; and, besides, great
geniuses do not belong to the particular land of their birth:
they scarcely belong to this earth, the Golgotha of their
sufferings.&nbsp; The mass&mdash;the English blockheads, God
forgive me!&mdash;are hateful to me in my inmost soul; and I
often regard them not at all as my fellow-men, but as miserable
automata&mdash;machines, whose motive power is egoism.&nbsp; In
these moods, it seems to me as if I heard the whizzing wheelwork
by which they think, feel, reckon, digest, and pray: their
praying, their mechanical Anglican church-going, with the gilt
Prayer-book under their arms, their stupid, tiresome Sunday,
their awkward piety, is most of all odious to me.&nbsp; I am
firmly convinced that a blaspheming Frenchman is a more pleasing
sight for the Divinity than a praying Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his return from England Heine was employed at Munich in
editing the <i>Allgemeinen Politischen Annalen</i>, but in 1830
he was again in the north, and the news of the July Revolution
surprised him on the island of Heligoland.&nbsp; He has given us
a graphic picture of his democratic enthusiasm in those days in
some letters, apparently written from Heligoland, which he has
inserted in his book on B&ouml;rne.&nbsp; We quote some passages,
not only for their biographic interest as showing a phase of
Heine&rsquo;s mental history, but because they are a specimen of
his power in that kind of dithyrambic writing which, in less
masterly hands, easily becomes ridiculous:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The thick packet of newspapers arrived from
the Continent with these warm, glowing-hot tidings.&nbsp; They
were sunbeams wrapped up in packing-paper, and they inflamed my
soul till it burst into the wildest conflagration. . . . It is
all like a dream to me; especially the name Lafayette sounds to
me like a legend out of my earliest childhood.&nbsp; Does he
really sit again on horseback, commanding the National
Guard?&nbsp; I almost fear it may not be true, for it is in
print.&nbsp; I will myself go to Paris, to be convinced of it
with my bodily eyes. . . . It must be splendid, when he rides
through the street, the citizen of two worlds, the godlike old
man, with his silver locks streaming down his sacred shoulder. .
. . He greets, <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>with his dear old eyes, the
grandchildren of those who once fought with him for freedom and
equality. . . . It is now sixty years since he returned from
America with the Declaration of Human Rights, the decalogue of
the world&rsquo;s new creed, which was revealed to him amid the
thunders and lightnings of cannon. . . . And the tricolored flag
waves again on the towers of Paris, and its streets resound with
the Marseillaise! . . . It is all over with my yearning for
repose.&nbsp; I now know again what I will do, what I ought to
do, what I must do. . . . I am the son of the Revolution, and
seize again the hallowed weapons on which my mother pronounced
her magic benediction. . . . Flowers! flowers! I will crown my
head for the death-fight.&nbsp; And the lyre too, reach me the
lyre, that I may sing a battle-song. . . . Words like flaming
stars, that shoot down from the heavens, and burn up the palaces,
and illuminate the huts. . . . Words like bright javelins, that
whirr up to the seventh heaven and strike the pious hypocrites
who have skulked into the Holy of Holies. . . . I am all joy and
song, all sword and flame!&nbsp; Perhaps, too, all delirium. . .
. One of those sunbeams wrapped in brown paper has flown to my
brain, and set my thoughts aglow.&nbsp; In vain I dip my head
into the sea.&nbsp; No water extinguishes this Greek fire: . . .
Even the poor Heligolanders shout for joy, although they have
only a sort of dim instinct of what has occurred.&nbsp; The
fisherman who yesterday took me over to the little sand island,
which is the bathing-place here, said to me smilingly, &lsquo;The
poor people have won!&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes; instinctively the people
comprehend such events, perhaps, better than we, with all our
means of knowledge.&nbsp; Thus Frau von Varnhagen once told me
that when the issue of the Battle of Leipzig was not yet known,
the maid-servant suddenly rushed into the room with the sorrowful
cry, &lsquo;The nobles have won!&rsquo; . . . This morning
another packet of newspapers is come, I devour them like
manna.&nbsp; Child that I am, affecting details touch me yet more
than the momentous whole.&nbsp; Oh, if I could but see the dog
Medor. . . . The dog Medor brought his master his gun and
cartridge-box, and when his master fell, and was buried with his
fellow-heroes in the Court of the Louvre, there stayed the poor
dog like a monument of faithfulness, sitting motionless on the
grave, day and night, eating but little of the food that was
offered him&mdash;burying the greater part of it in the earth,
perhaps as nourishment for his buried master!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enthusiasm which was kept thus at boiling heat by
imagination, cooled down rapidly when brought into contact <!--
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>with reality.&nbsp; In the same book be indicates, in
his caustic way, the commencement of that change in his political
<i>temperature</i>&mdash;for it cannot be called a change in
opinion&mdash;which has drawn down on him immense vituperation
from some of the patriotic party, but which seems to have
resulted simply from the essential antagonism between keen wit
and fanaticism.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the very first days of my arrival in
Paris I observed that things wore, in reality, quite different
colors from those which had been shed on them, when in
perspective, by the light of my enthusiasm.&nbsp; The silver
locks which I saw fluttering so majestically on the shoulders of
Lafayette, the hero of two worlds, were metamorphosed into a
brown perruque, which made a pitiable covering for a narrow
skull.&nbsp; And even the dog Medor, which I visited in the Court
of the Louvre, and which, encamped under tricolored flags and
trophies, very quietly allowed himself to be fed&mdash;he was not
at all the right dog, but quite an ordinary brute, who assumed to
himself merits not his own, as often happens with the French;
and, like many others, he made a profit out of the glory of the
Revolution. . . .&nbsp; He was pampered and patronized, perhaps
promoted to the highest posts, while the true Medor, some days
after the battle, modestly slunk out of sight, like the true
people who created the Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That it was not merely interest in French politics which sent
Heine to Paris in 1831, but also a perception that German air was
not friendly to sympathizers in July revolutions, is humorously
intimated in the &ldquo;Gest&auml;ndnisse.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I had done much and suffered much, and when
the sun of the July Revolution arose in France, I had become very
weary, and needed some recreation.&nbsp; Also, my native air was
every day more unhealthy for me, and it was time I should
seriously think of a change of climate.&nbsp; I had visions: the
clouds terrified me, and made all sorts of ugly faces at
me.&nbsp; It often seemed to me as if the sun were a Prussian
cockade; at night I dreamed of a hideous black eagle, which
gnawed my liver; and I was very melancholy.&nbsp; Add to this, I
had become acquainted with an old Berlin Justizrath, who had
spent many years in the fortress of Spandau, and he related to me
how unpleasant it is when one is obliged to wear irons in
winter.&nbsp; For myself I thought it very unchristian that the
irons were not warmed a trifle.&nbsp; If the irons were warmed a
little for us they would not make <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>so
unpleasant an impression, and even chilly natures might then bear
them very well; it would be only proper consideration, too, if
the fetters were perfumed with essence of roses and laurels, as
is the case in this country (France).&nbsp; I asked my Justizrath
whether he often got oysters to eat at Spandau?&nbsp; He said,
No; Spandau was too far from the sea.&nbsp; Moreover, he said
meat was very scarce there, and there was no kind of
<i>volaille</i> except flies, which fell into one&rsquo;s soup. .
. . Now, as I really needed some recreation, and as Spandau is
too far from the sea for oysters to be got there, and the Spandau
fly-soup did not seem very appetizing to me, as, besides all
this, the Prussian chains are very cold in winter, and could not
be conducive to my health, I resolved to visit Paris.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this time Paris has been Heine&rsquo;s home, and his
best prose works have been written either to inform the Germans
on French affairs or to inform the French on German philosophy
and literature.&nbsp; He became a correspondent of the
<i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, and his correspondence, which extends,
with an interruption of several years, from 1831 to 1844, forms
the volume entitled &ldquo;Franz&ouml;sische Zust&auml;nde&rdquo;
(French Affairs), and the second and third volume of his
&ldquo;Vermischte Schriften.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a witty and often
wise commentary on public men and public events: Louis Philippe,
Casimir P&eacute;rier, Thiers, Guizot, Rothschild, the Catholic
party, the Socialist party, have their turn of satire and
appreciation, for Heine deals out both with an impartiality which
made his less favorable critics&mdash;B&ouml;rne, for
example&mdash;charge him with the rather incompatible sins of
reckless caprice and venality.&nbsp; Literature and art alternate
with politics: we have now a sketch of George Sand or a
description of one of Horace Vernet&rsquo;s pictures; now a
criticism of Victor Hugo or of Liszt; now an irresistible
caricature of Spontini or Kalkbrenner; and occasionally the
predominant satire is relieved by a fine saying or a genial word
of admiration.&nbsp; And all is done with that airy lightness,
yet precision of touch, which distinguishes Heine beyond any
living writer.&nbsp; The charge of venality was loudly made
against Heine in Germany: first, it was said that he was paid to
write; then, that he was paid to abstain from writing; <!-- page
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>and the accusations were supposed to have an
irrefragable basis in the fact that he accepted a stipend from
the French government.&nbsp; He has never attempted to conceal
the reception of that stipend, and we think his statement (in the
&ldquo;Vermischte Schriften&rdquo;) of the circumstances under
which it was offered and received, is a sufficient vindication of
himself and M. Guizot from any dishonor in the matter.</p>
<p>It may be readily imagined that Heine, with so large a share
of the Gallic element as he has in his composition, was soon at
his ease in Parisian society, and the years here were bright with
intellectual activity and social enjoyment.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
wit,&rdquo; wrote August Lewald, &ldquo;is a perpetual gushing
fountain; he throws off the most delicious descriptions with
amazing facility, and sketches the most comic characters in
conversations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a man could not be neglected in
Paris, and Heine was sought on all sides&mdash;as a guest in
distinguished salons, as a possible proselyte in the circle of
the Saint Simonians.&nbsp; His literary productiveness seems to
have been furthered by his congenial life, which, however, was
soon to some extent embittered by the sense of exile; for since
1835 both his works and his person have been the object of
denunciation by the German governments.&nbsp; Between 1833 and
1845 appeared the four volumes of the &ldquo;Salon,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Die Romantische Schule&rdquo; (both written, in the first
instance, in French), the book on B&ouml;rne, &ldquo;Atta
Troll,&rdquo; a romantic poem, &ldquo;Deutschland,&rdquo; an
exquisitely humorous poem, describing his last visit to Germany,
and containing some grand passages of serious writing; and the
&ldquo;Neue Gedichte,&rdquo; a collection of lyrical poems.&nbsp;
Among the most interesting of his prose works are the second
volume of the &ldquo;Salon,&rdquo; which contains a survey of
religion and philosophy in Germany, and the &ldquo;Romantische
Schule,&rdquo; a delightful introduction to that phase of German
literature known as the Romantic school.&nbsp; The book on
B&ouml;rne, which appeared in 1840, two years after the death of
that writer, excited great indignation in Germany, as a wreaking
of vengeance on the dead, an insult to the memory of a man who
<!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>had worked and suffered in the cause of freedom&mdash;a
cause which was Heine&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; B&ouml;rne, we may
observe parenthetically for the information of those who are not
familiar with recent German literature, was a remarkable
political writer of the ultra-liberal party in Germany, who
resided in Paris at the same time with Heine: a man of stern,
uncompromising partisanship and bitter humor.&nbsp; Without
justifying Heine&rsquo;s production of this book, we see excuses
for him which should temper the condemnation passed on it.&nbsp;
There was a radical opposition of nature between him and
B&ouml;rne; to use his own distinction, Heine is a
Hellene&mdash;sensuous, realistic, exquisitely alive to the
beautiful; while B&ouml;rne was a Nazarene&mdash;ascetic,
spiritualistic, despising the pure artist as destitute of
earnestness.&nbsp; Heine has too keen a perception of practical
absurdities and damaging exaggerations ever to become a
thoroughgoing partisan; and with a love of freedom, a faith in
the ultimate triumph of democratic principles, of which we see no
just reason to doubt the genuineness and consistency, he has been
unable to satisfy more zealous and one-sided liberals by giving
his adhesion to their views and measures, or by adopting a
denunciatory tone against those in the opposite ranks.&nbsp;
B&ouml;rne could not forgive what he regarded as Heine&rsquo;s
epicurean indifference and artistic dalliance, and he at length
gave vent to his antipathy in savage attacks on him through the
press, accusing him of utterly lacking character and principle,
and even of writing under the influence of venal motives.&nbsp;
To these attacks Heine remained absolutely mute&mdash;from
contempt according to his own account; but the retort, which he
resolutely refrained from making during B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s life,
comes in this volume published after his death with the
concentrated force of long-gathering thunder.&nbsp; The utterly
inexcusable part of the book is the caricature of
B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s friend, Madame Wohl, and the scurrilous
insinuations concerning B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s domestic life.&nbsp;
It is said, we know not with how much truth, that Heine had to
answer for these in a duel with Madame Wohl&rsquo;s husband, and
that, after receiving a serious wound, he promised <!-- page
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>to
withdraw the offensive matter from a future edition.&nbsp; That
edition, however, has not been called for.&nbsp; Whatever else we
may think of the book, it is impossible to deny its transcendent
talent&mdash;the dramatic vigor with which B&ouml;rne is made
present to us, the critical acumen with which he is
characterized, and the wonderful play of wit, pathos, and thought
which runs through the whole.&nbsp; But we will let Heine speak
for himself, and first we will give part of his graphic
description of the way in which B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s mind and
manners grated on his taste:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the disgust which, in intercourse with
B&ouml;rne, I was in danger of feeling toward those who
surrounded him, was added the annoyance I felt from his perpetual
talk about politics.&nbsp; Nothing but political argument, and
again political argument, even at table, where he managed to hunt
me out.&nbsp; At dinner, when I so gladly forget all the
vexations of the world, he spoiled the best dishes for me by his
patriotic gall, which he poured as a bitter sauce over
everything.&nbsp; Calf&rsquo;s feet, <i>&agrave; la ma&icirc;tre
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</i>, then my innocent <i>bonne bouche</i>, he
completely spoiled for me by Job&rsquo;s tidings from Germany,
which he scraped together out of the most unreliable
newspapers.&nbsp; And then his accursed remarks, which spoiled
one&rsquo;s appetite! . . . This was a sort of table-talk which
did not greatly exhilarate me, and I avenged myself by affecting
an excessive, almost impassioned indifference for the object of
B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s enthusiasm.&nbsp; For example, B&ouml;rne was
indignant that immediately on my arrival in Paris I had nothing
better to do than to write for German papers a long account of
the Exhibition of Pictures.&nbsp; I omit all discussion as to
whether that interest in Art which induced me to undertake this
work was so utterly irreconcilable with the revolutionary
interests of the day; but B&ouml;rne saw in it a proof of my
indifference toward the sacred cause of humanity, and I could in
my turn spoil the taste of his patriotic <i>sauerkraut</i> for
him by talking all dinner-time of nothing but pictures, of
Robert&rsquo;s &lsquo;Reapers,&rsquo; Horace Vernet&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Judith,&rsquo; and Scheffer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust.&rsquo; .
. . That I never thought it worth while to discuss my political
principles with him it is needless to say; and once when he
declared that he had found a contradiction in my writings, I
satisfied myself with the ironical answer, &lsquo;You are
mistaken, <i>mon cher</i>; such contradictions never occur in my
works, for always before I begin to write, I read over the
statement of my political principles in my previous writings,
that I may not contradict myself, and that no one may be able to
reproach me with apostasy from my liberal
principles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>And here is his own account of the spirit in which the
book was written:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was never B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s friend, nor
was I ever his enemy.&nbsp; The displeasure which he could often
excite in me was never very important, and he atoned for it
sufficiently by the cold silence which I opposed to all his
accusations and raillery.&nbsp; While he lived I wrote not a line
against him, I never thought about him, I ignored him completely;
and that enraged him beyond measure.&nbsp; If I now speak of him,
I do so neither out of enthusiasm nor out of uneasiness; I am
conscious of the coolest impartiality.&nbsp; I write here neither
an apology nor a critique, and as in painting the man I go on my
own observation, the image I present of him ought perhaps to be
regarded as a real portrait.&nbsp; And such a monument is due to
him&mdash;to the great wrestler who, in the arena of our
political games, wrestled so courageously, and earned, if not the
laurel, certainly the crown of oak leaves.&nbsp; I give an image
with his true features, without idealization&mdash;the more like
him the more honorable for his memory.&nbsp; He was neither a
genius nor a hero; he was no Olympian god.&nbsp; He was a man, a
denizen of this earth; he was a good writer and a great patriot.
. . . Beautiful, delicious peace, which I feel at this moment in
the depths of my soul!&nbsp; Thou rewardest me sufficiently for
everything I have done and for everything I have despised. . . .
I shall defend myself neither from the reproach of indifference
nor from the suspicion of venality.&nbsp; I have for years,
during the life of the insinuator, held such self-justification
unworthy of me; now even decency demands silence.&nbsp; That
would be a frightful spectacle!&mdash;polemics between Death and
Exile!&nbsp; Dost thou stretch out to me a beseeching hand from
the grave?&nbsp; Without rancor I reach mine toward thee. . . .
See how noble it is and pure!&nbsp; It was never soiled by
pressing the hands of the mob, any more than by the impure gold
of the people&rsquo;s enemy.&nbsp; In reality thou hast never
injured me. . . . In all thy insinuations there is not a <i>louis
d&rsquo;or&rsquo;s</i> worth of truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one of these years Heine was married, and, in deference to
the sentiments of his wife, married according to the rites of the
Catholic Church.&nbsp; On this fact busy rumor afterward founded
the story of his conversion to Catholicism, and could of course
name the day and spot on which he abjured Protestanism.&nbsp; In
his &ldquo;Gest&auml;ndnisse&rdquo; Heine publishes a denial of
this rumor; less, he says, for the sake of depriving the
Catholics <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>of the solace they may derive from
their belief in a new convert, than in order to cut off from
another party the more spiteful satisfaction of bewailing his
instability:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That statement of time and place was
entirely correct.&nbsp; I was actually on the specified day in
the specified church, which was, moreover, a Jesuit church,
namely, St. Sulpice; and I then went through a religious
act.&nbsp; But this act was no odious abjuration, but a very
innocent conjugation; that is to say, my marriage, already
performed, according to the civil law there received the
ecclesiastical consecration, because my wife, whose family are
staunch Catholics, would not have thought her marriage sacred
enough without such a ceremony.&nbsp; And I would on no account
cause this beloved being any uneasiness or disturbance in her
religious views.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For sixteen years&mdash;from 1831 to 1847&mdash;Heine lived
that rapid concentrated life which is known only in Paris; but
then, alas! stole on the &ldquo;days of darkness,&rdquo; and they
were to be many.&nbsp; In 1847 he felt the approach of the
terrible spinal disease which has for seven years chained him to
his bed in acute suffering.&nbsp; The last time he went out of
doors, he tells us, was in May, 1848:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With difficulty I dragged myself to the
Louvre, and I almost sank down as I entered the magnificent hall
where the ever-blessed goddess of beauty, our beloved Lady of
Milo, stands on her pedestal.&nbsp; At her feet I lay long, and
wept so bitterly that a stone must have pitied me.&nbsp; The
goddess looked compassionately on me, but at the same time
disconsolately, as if she would say, Dost thou not see, then,
that I have no arms, and thus cannot help thee?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since 1848, then, this poet, whom the lovely objects of Nature
have always &ldquo;haunted like a passion,&rdquo; has not
descended from the second story of a Parisian house; this man of
hungry intellect has been shut out from all direct observation of
life, all contact with society, except such as is derived from
visitors to his sick-room.&nbsp; The terrible nervous disease has
affected his eyes; the sight of one is utterly gone, and he can
only raise the lid of the other by lifting it with his
finger.&nbsp; Opium alone is the beneficent genius that stills
his pain.&nbsp; We hardly know <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>whether to
call it an alleviation or an intensification of the torture that
Heine retains his mental vigor, his poetic imagination, and his
incisive wit; for if this intellectual activity fills up a blank,
it widens the sphere of suffering.&nbsp; His brother described
him in 1851 as still, in moments when the hand of pain was not
too heavy on him, the same Heinrich Heine, poet and satirist by
turns.&nbsp; In such moments he would narrate the strangest
things in the gravest manner.&nbsp; But when he came to an end,
he would roguishly lift up the lid of his right eye with his
finger to see the impression he had produced; and if his audience
had been listening with a serious face, he would break into
Homeric laughter.&nbsp; We have other proof than personal
testimony that Heine&rsquo;s disease allows his genius to retain
much of its energy, in the &ldquo;Romanzero,&rdquo; a volume of
poems published in 1851, and written chiefly during the three
first years of his illness; and in the first volume of the
&ldquo;Vermischte Schriften,&rdquo; also the product of recent
years.&nbsp; Very plaintive is the poet&rsquo;s own description
of his condition, in the epilogue to the
&ldquo;Romanzero:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do I really exist?&nbsp; My body is so
shrunken that I am hardly anything but a voice; and my bed
reminds me of the singing grave of the magician Merlin, which
lies in the forest of Brozeliand, in Brittany, under tall oaks
whose tops soar like green flames toward heaven.&nbsp;
Alas!&nbsp; I envy thee those trees and the fresh breeze that
moves their branches, brother Merlin, for no green leaf rustles
about my mattress-grave in Paris, where early and late I hear
nothing but the rolling of vehicles, hammering, quarrelling, and
piano-strumming.&nbsp; A grave without repose, death without the
privileges of the dead, who have no debts to pay, and need write
neither letters nor books&mdash;that is a piteous
condition.&nbsp; Long ago the measure has been taken for my
coffin and for my necrology, but I die so slowly that the process
is tedious for me as well as my friends.&nbsp; But patience:
everything has an end.&nbsp; You will one day find the booth
closed where the puppet-show of my humor has so often delighted
you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As early as 1850 it was rumored that since Heine&rsquo;s
illness a change had taken place in his religious views; and as
rumor seldom stops short of extremes, it was soon said that he
had <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>become a thorough pietist.&nbsp;
Catholics and Protestants by turns claiming him as a
convert.&nbsp; Such a change in so uncompromising an iconoclast,
in a man who had been so zealous in his negations as Heine,
naturally excited considerable sensation in the camp he was
supposed to have quitted, as well as in that he was supposed to
have joined.&nbsp; In the second volume of the
&ldquo;Salon,&rdquo; and in the &ldquo;Romantische Schule,&rdquo;
written in 1834 and &rsquo;35, the doctrine of Pantheism is dwelt
on with a fervor and unmixed seriousness which show that
Pantheism was then an animating faith to Heine, and he attacks
what he considers the false spiritualism and asceticism of
Christianity as the enemy of true beauty in Art, and of social
well-being.&nbsp; Now, however, it was said that Heine had
recanted all his heresies; but from the fact that visitors to his
sick-room brought away very various impressions as to his actual
religious views, it seemed probable that his love of
mystification had found a tempting opportunity for exercise on
this subject, and that, as one of his friends said, he was not
inclined to pour out unmixed wine to those who asked for a sample
out of mere curiosity.&nbsp; At length, in the epilogue to the
&ldquo;Romanzero,&rdquo; dated 1851, there appeared, amid much
mystifying banter, a declaration that he had embraced Theism and
the belief in a future life, and what chiefly lent an air of
seriousness and reliability to this affirmation was the fact that
he took care to accompany it with certain negations:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As concerns myself, I can boast of no
particular progress in politics; I adhered (after 1848) to the
same democratic principles which had the homage of my youth, and
for which I have ever since glowed with increasing fervor.&nbsp;
In theology, on the contrary, I must accuse myself of
retrogression, since, as I have already confessed, I returned to
the old superstition&mdash;to a personal God.&nbsp; This fact is,
once for all, not to be stifled, as many enlightened and
well-meaning friends would fain have had it.&nbsp; But I must
expressly contradict the report that my retrograde movement has
carried me as far as to the threshold of a Church, and that I
have even been received into her lap.&nbsp; No: my religions
convictions and views have remained free from any tincture of
ecclesiasticism; no chiming of bells has allured me, no <!-- page
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>altar candles have dazzled me.&nbsp; I have dallied
with no dogmas, and have not utterly renounced my
reason.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a serious statement.&nbsp; But what shall we
say to a convert who plays with his newly-acquired belief in a
future life, as Heine does in the very next page?&nbsp; He says
to his reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Console thyself; we shall meet again in a
better world, where I also mean to write thee better books.&nbsp;
I take for granted that my health will there be improved, and
that Swedenborg has not deceived me.&nbsp; He relates, namely,
with great confidence, that we shall peacefully carry on our old
occupations in the other world, just as we have done in this;
that we shall there preserve our individuality unaltered, and
that death will produce no particular change in our organic
development.&nbsp; Swedenborg is a thoroughly honorable fellow,
and quite worthy of credit in what he tells us about the other
world, where he saw with his own eyes the persons who had played
a great part on our earth.&nbsp; Most of them, he says, remained
unchanged, and busied themselves with the same things as
formerly; they remained stationary, were old-fashioned,
<i>rococo</i>&mdash;which now and then produced a ludicrous
effect.&nbsp; For example, our dear Dr. Martin Luther kept fast
by his doctrine of Grace, about which he had for three hundred
years daily written down the same mouldy arguments&mdash;just in
the same way as the late Baron Ekstein, who during twenty years
printed in the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> one and the same
article, perpetually chewing over again the old cud of Jesuitical
doctrine.&nbsp; But, as we have said, all persons who once
figured here below were not found by Swedenborg in such a state
of fossil immutability: many had considerably developed their
character, both for good and evil, in the other world; and this
gave rise to some singular results.&nbsp; Some who had been
heroes and saints on earth had <i>there</i> sunk into scamps and
good-for-nothings; and there were examples, too, of a contrary
transformation.&nbsp; For instance, the fumes of self-conceit
mounted to Saint Anthony&rsquo;s head when he learned what
immense veneration and adoration had been paid to him by all
Christendom; and he who here below withstood the most terrible
temptations was now quite an impertinent rascal and dissolute
gallows-bird, who vied with his pig in rolling himself in the
mud.&nbsp; The chaste Susanna, from having been excessively vain
of her virtue, which she thought indomitable, came to a shameful
fall, and she who once so gloriously resisted the two old men,
was a victim to the seductions of the young Absalom, the son of
David.&nbsp; On the contrary, Lot&rsquo;s daughters had in the
lapse of time become <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>very virtuous, and passed in the
other world for models of propriety: the old man, alas! had stuck
to the wine-flask.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his &ldquo;Gest&auml;ndnisse,&rdquo; the retractation of
former opinions and profession of Theism are renewed, but in a
strain of irony that repels our sympathy and baffles our
psychology.&nbsp; Yet what strange, deep pathos is mingled with
the audacity of the following passage!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What avails it me, that enthusiastic youths
and maidens crown my marble bust with laurel, when the withered
hands of an aged nurse are pressing Spanish flies behind my
ears?&nbsp; What avails it me, that all the roses of Shiraz glow
and waft incense for me?&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Shiraz is two thousand
miles from the Rue d&rsquo;Amsterdam, where, in the wearisome
loneliness of my sick-room, I get no scent, except it be,
perhaps, the perfume of warmed towels.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s satire weighs heavily on me.&nbsp; The great Author
of the universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven, was bent on
demonstrating, with crushing force, to me, the little, earthly,
German Aristophanes, how my wittiest sarcasms are only pitiful
attempts at jesting in comparison with His, and how miserably I
am beneath him in humor, in colossal mockery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our own part, we regard the paradoxical irreverence with
which Heine professes his theoretical reverence as pathological,
as the diseased exhibition of a predominant tendency urged into
anomalous action by the pressure of pain and mental
privation&mdash;as a delirium of wit starved of its proper
nourishment.&nbsp; It is not for us to condemn, who have never
had the same burden laid on us; it is not for pigmies at their
ease to criticise the writhings of the Titan chained to the
rock.</p>
<p>On one other point we must touch before quitting Heine&rsquo;s
personal history.&nbsp; There is a standing accusation against
him in some quarters of wanting political principle, of wishing
to denationalize himself, and of indulging in insults against his
native country.&nbsp; Whatever ground may exist for these
accusations, that ground is not, so far as we see, to be found in
his writings.&nbsp; He may not have much faith in German
revolutions and revolutionists; experience, in his case as in
that of others, may have thrown his millennial anticipations into
more distant <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>perspective; but we see no evidence
that he has ever swerved from his attachment to the principles of
freedom, or written anything which to a philosophic mind is
incompatible with true patriotism.&nbsp; He has expressly denied
the report that he wished to become naturalized in France; and
his yearning toward his native land and the accents of his native
language is expressed with a pathos the more reliable from the
fact that he is sparing in such effusions.&nbsp; We do not see
why Heine&rsquo;s satire of the blunders and foibles of his
fellow-countrymen should be denounced as a crime of
<i>l&egrave;se-patrie</i>, any more than the political
caricatures of any other satirist.&nbsp; The real offences of
Heine are his occasional coarseness and his unscrupulous
personalities, which are reprehensible, not because they are
directed against his fellow-countrymen, but because they are
<i>personalities</i>.&nbsp; That these offences have their
precedents in men whose memory the world delights to honor does
not remove their turpitude, but it is a fact which should modify
our condemnation in a particular case; unless, indeed, we are to
deliver our judgments on a principle of compensation&mdash;making
up for our indulgence in one direction by our severity in
another.&nbsp; On this ground of coarseness and personality, a
true bill may be found against Heine; <i>not</i>, we think, on
the ground that he has laughed at what is laughable in his
compatriots.&nbsp; Here is a specimen of the satire under which
we suppose German patriots wince:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rhenish Bavaria was to be the
starting-point of the German revolution.&nbsp; Zweibr&uuml;cken
was the Bethlehem in which the infant
Saviour&mdash;Freedom&mdash;lay in the cradle, and gave
whimpering promise of redeeming the world.&nbsp; Near his cradle
bellowed many an ox, who afterward, when his horns were reckoned
on, showed himself a very harmless brute.&nbsp; It was
confidently believed that the German revolution would begin in
Zweibr&uuml;cken, and everything was there ripe for an
outbreak.&nbsp; But, as has been hinted, the tender-heartedness
of some persons frustrated that illegal undertaking.&nbsp; For
example, among the Bipontine conspirators there was a tremendous
braggart, who was always loudest in his rage, who boiled over
with the hatred of tyranny, and this man was fixed on to strike
the first blow, by <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>cutting down a sentinel who kept an
important post. . . . . &lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried the man, when
this order was given him&mdash;&lsquo;What!&mdash;me!&nbsp; Can
you expect so horrible, so bloodthirsty an act of me?&nbsp;
I&mdash;<i>I</i>, kill an innocent sentinel?&nbsp; I, who am the
father of a family!&nbsp; And this sentinel is perhaps also
father of a family.&nbsp; One father of a family kill another
father of a family?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;
Kill&mdash;murder!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In political matters Heine, like all men whose intellect and
taste predominate too far over their impulses to allow of their
becoming partisans, is offensive alike to the aristocrat and the
democrat.&nbsp; By the one he is denounced as a man who holds
incendiary principles, by the other as a half-hearted
&ldquo;trimmer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has no sympathy, as he says, with
&ldquo;that vague, barren pathos, that useless effervescence of
enthusiasm, which plunges, with the spirit of a martyr, into an
ocean of generalities, and which always reminds me of the
American sailor, who had so fervent an enthusiasm for General
Jackson, that he at last sprang from the top of a mast into the
sea, crying, &ldquo;<i>I die for General Jackson</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But thou liest, Brutus, thou liest,
Cassius, and thou, too, liest, Asinius, in maintaining that my
ridicule attacks those ideas which are the precious acquisition
of Humanity, and for which I myself have so striven and
suffered.&nbsp; No! for the very reason that those ideas
constantly hover before the poet in glorious splendor and
majesty, he is the more irresistibly overcome by laughter when he
sees how rudely, awkwardly, and clumsily those ideas are seized
and mirrored in the contracted minds of contemporaries. . . .
There are mirrors which have so rough a surface that even an
Apollo reflected in them becomes a caricature, and excites our
laughter.&nbsp; <i>But we laugh then only at the caricature</i>,
<i>not at the god</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the rest, why should we demand of Heine that he should be
a hero, a patriot, a solemn prophet, any more than we should
demand of a gazelle that it should draw well in harness?&nbsp;
Nature has not made him of her sterner stuff&mdash;not of iron
and adamant, but of pollen of flowers, the juice of the grape,
and Puck&rsquo;s mischievous brain, plenteously mixing also the
dews of kindly affection and the gold-dust of noble
thoughts.&nbsp; It is, after all, a <i>tribute</i> which his
enemies pay him when they utter <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>their
bitterest dictum, namely, that he is &ldquo;<i>nur
Dichter</i>&rdquo;&mdash;only a poet.&nbsp; Let us accept this
point of view for the present, and, leaving all consideration of
him as a man, look at him simply as a poet and literary
artist.</p>
<p>Heine is essentially a lyric poet.&nbsp; The finest products
of his genius are</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Short swallow flights of song that dip<br
/>
Their wings in tears, and skim away;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and they are so emphatically songs that, in reading them, we
feel as if each must have a twin melody born in the same moment
and by the same inspiration.&nbsp; Heine is too impressible and
mercurial for any sustained production; even in his short lyrics
his tears sometimes pass into laughter and his laughter into
tears; and his longer poems, &ldquo;Atta Troll&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Deutschland,&rdquo; are full of Ariosto-like
transitions.&nbsp; His song has a wide compass of notes; he can
take us to the shores of the Northern Sea and thrill us by the
sombre sublimity of his pictures and dreamy fancies; he can draw
forth our tears by the voice he gives to our own sorrows, or to
the sorrows of &ldquo;Poor Peter;&rdquo; he can throw a cold
shudder over us by a mysterious legend, a ghost story, or a still
more ghastly rendering of hard reality; he can charm us by a
quiet idyl, shake us with laughter at his overflowing fun, or
give us a piquant sensation of surprise by the ingenuity of his
transitions from the lofty to the ludicrous.&nbsp; This last
power is not, indeed, essentially poetical; but only a poet can
use it with the same success as Heine, for only a poet can poise
our emotion and expectation at such a height as to give effect to
the sudden fall.&nbsp; Heine&rsquo;s greatest power as a poet
lies in his simple pathos, in the ever-varied but always natural
expression he has given to the tender emotions.&nbsp; We may
perhaps indicate this phase of his genius by referring to
Wordsworth&rsquo;s beautiful little poem, &ldquo;She dwelt among
the untrodden ways;&rdquo; the conclusion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She dwelt alone, and few could know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucy ceased to be;<br />
But she is in her grave, and, oh!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference to me&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>is entirely in Heine&rsquo;s manner; and so is
Tennyson&rsquo;s poem of a dozen lines, called
&ldquo;Circumstance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both these poems have
Heine&rsquo;s pregnant simplicity.&nbsp; But, lest this
comparison should mislead, we must say that there is no general
resemblance between either Wordsworth, or Tennyson, and
Heine.&nbsp; Their greatest qualities lie quite a way from the
light, delicate lucidity, the easy, rippling music, of
Heine&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; The distinctive charm of his lyrics
may best be seen by comparing them with Goethe&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Both have the same masterly, finished simplicity and rhythmic
grace; but there is more thought mingled with Goethe&rsquo;s
feeling&mdash;his lyrical genius is a vessel that draws more
water than Heine&rsquo;s, and, though it seems to glide along
with equal ease, we have a sense of greater weight and force,
accompanying the grace of its movements.</p>
<p>But for this very reason Heine touches our hearts more
strongly; his songs are all music and feeling&mdash;they are like
birds that not only enchant us with their delicious notes, but
nestle against us with their soft breasts, and make us feel the
agitated beating of their hearts.&nbsp; He indicates a whole sad
history in a single quatrain; there is not an image in it, not a
thought; but it is beautiful, simple, and perfect as a &ldquo;big
round tear&rdquo;&mdash;it is pure feeling, breathed in pure
music:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Anfangs wollt&rsquo; ich fast verzagen<br
/>
Und ich glaubt&rsquo; ich trug es nie,<br />
Und ich hab&rsquo; es doch getragen&mdash;<br />
Aber fragt mich nur nicht, wie.&rdquo; <a
name="citation134"></a><a href="#footnote134"
class="citation">[134]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He excels equally in the more imaginative expression of
feeling: he represents it by a brief image, like a finely cut
cameo; he expands it into a mysterious dream, or dramatizes it in
a little story, half ballad, half idyl; and in all these forms
his art is so perfect that we never have a sense of artificiality
or of unsuccessful effort; but all seems to have developed itself
by the same beautiful necessity that brings forth vine-leaves and
<!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>grapes and the natural curls of childhood.&nbsp; Of
Heine&rsquo;s humorous poetry, &ldquo;Deutschland&rdquo; is the
most charming specimen&mdash;charming, especially, because its
wit and humor grow out of a rich loam of thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Atta Troll&rdquo; is more original, more various, more
fantastic; but it is too great a strain on the imagination to be
a general favorite.&nbsp; We have said that feeling is the
element in which Heine&rsquo;s poetic genius habitually floats;
but he can occasionally soar to a higher region, and impart deep
significance to picturesque symbolism; he can flash a sublime
thought over the past and into the future; he can pour forth a
lofty strain of hope or indignation.&nbsp; Few could forget,
after once hearing them, the stanzas at the close of
&ldquo;Deutschland,&rdquo; in which he warns the King of Prussia
not to incur the irredeemable hell which the injured poet can
create for him&mdash;the <i>singing flames</i> of a Dante&rsquo;s
<i>terza rima</i>!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Kennst du die H&ouml;lle des Dante
nicht,<br />
Die schrecklichen Terzetten?<br />
Wen da der Dichter hineingesperrt<br />
Den kann kein Gott mehr retten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kein Gott, kein Heiland, erl&ouml;st ihn je<br />
Aus diesen singenden Flammen!<br />
Nimm dich in Acht, das wir dich nicht<br />
Zu solcher H&ouml;lle verdammen.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a

class="citation">[135]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a prosaist, Heine is, in one point of view, even more
distinguished than as a poet.&nbsp; The German language easily
lends itself to all the purposes of poetry; like the ladies of
the Middle Ages, it is gracious and compliant to the
Troubadours.&nbsp; But as these same ladies were often crusty and
repulsive to their <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>unmusical mates, so the German
language generally appears awkward and unmanageable in the hands
of prose writers.&nbsp; Indeed, the number of really fine German
prosaists before Heine would hardly have exceeded the numerating
powers of a New Hollander, who can count three and no more.&nbsp;
Persons the most familiar with German prose testify that there is
an extra fatigue in reading it, just as we feel an extra fatigue
from our walk when it takes us over ploughed clay.&nbsp; But in
Heine&rsquo;s hands German prose, usually so heavy, so clumsy, so
dull, becomes, like clay in the hands of the chemist, compact,
metallic, brilliant; it is German in an <i>allotropic</i>
condition.&nbsp; No dreary labyrinthine sentences in which you
find &ldquo;no end in wandering mazes lost;&rdquo; no chains of
adjectives in linked harshness long drawn out; no digressions
thrown in as parentheses; but crystalline definiteness and
clearness, fine and varied rhythm, and all that delicate
precision, all those felicities of word and cadence, which belong
to the highest order of prose.&nbsp; And Heine has
proved&mdash;what Madame de St&auml;el seems to have
doubted&mdash;that it is possible to be witty in German; indeed,
in reading him, you might imagine that German was pre-eminently
the language of wit, so flexible, so subtle, so piquant does it
become under his management.&nbsp; He is far more an artist in
prose than Goethe.&nbsp; He has not the breadth and repose, and
the calm development which belong to Goethe&rsquo;s style, for
they are foreign to his mental character; but he excels Goethe in
susceptibility to the manifold qualities of prose, and in mastery
over its effects.&nbsp; Heine is full of variety, of light and
shadow: he alternates between epigrammatic pith, imaginative
grace, sly allusion, and daring piquancy; and athwart all these
there runs a vein of sadness, tenderness, and grandeur which
reveals the poet.&nbsp; He continually throws out those finely
chiselled sayings which stamp themselves on the memory, and
become familiar by quotation.&nbsp; For example: &ldquo;The
People have time enough, they are immortal; kings only are
mortal.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wherever a great soul utters its
thoughts, there is Golgotha.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nature wanted to
see how she looked, and she <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>created
Goethe.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Only the man who has known bodily
suffering is truly a <i>man</i>; his limbs have their Passion
history, they are spiritualized.&rdquo;&nbsp; He calls Rubens
&ldquo;this Flemish Titan, the wings of whose genius were so
strong that he soared as high as the sun, in spite of the
hundred-weight of Dutch cheeses that hung on his
legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speaking of B&ouml;rne&rsquo;s dislike to the
calm creations of the true artist, he says, &ldquo;He was like a
child which, insensible to the glowing significance of a Greek
statue, only touches the marble and complains of cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most poetic and specifically humorous of Heine&rsquo;s
prose writings are the &ldquo;Reisebilder.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
comparison with Sterne is inevitable here; but Heine does not
suffer from it, for if he falls below Sterne in raciness of
humor, he is far above him in poetic sensibility and in reach and
variety of thought.&nbsp; Heine&rsquo;s humor is never
persistent, it never flows on long in easy gayety and drollery;
where it is not swelled by the tide of poetic feeling, it is
continually dashing down the precipice of a witticism.&nbsp; It
is not broad and unctuous; it is a&euml;rial and sprite-like, a
momentary resting-place between his poetry and his wit.&nbsp; In
the &ldquo;Reisebilder&rdquo; he runs through the whole gamut of
his powers, and gives us every hue of thought, from the wildly
droll and fantastic to the sombre and the terrible.&nbsp; Here is
a passage almost Dantesque in conception:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alas! one ought in truth to write against
no one in this world.&nbsp; Each of us is sick enough in this
great lazaretto, and many a polemical writing reminds me
involuntarily of a revolting quarrel, in a little hospital at
Cracow, of which I chanced to be a witness, and where it was
horrible to hear how the patients mockingly reproached each other
with their infirmities: how one who was wasted by consumption
jeered at another who was bloated by dropsy; how one laughed at
another&rsquo;s cancer in the nose, and this one again at his
neighbor&rsquo;s locked-jaw or squint, until at last the
delirious fever-patient sprang out of bed and tore away the
coverings from the wounded bodies of his companions, and nothing
was to be seen but hideous misery and mutilation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how fine is the transition in the very next chapter, <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>where, after quoting the Homeric description of the
feasting gods, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then suddenly approached, panting, a pale
Jew, with drops of blood on his brow, with a crown of thorns on
his head, and a great cross laid on his shoulders; and he threw
the cross on the high table of the gods, so that the golden cups
tottered, and the gods became dumb and pale, and grew ever paler,
till they at last melted away into vapor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The richest specimens of Heine&rsquo;s wit are perhaps to be
found in the works which have appeared since the
&ldquo;Reisebilder.&rdquo;&nbsp; The years, if they have
intensified his satirical bitterness, have also given his wit a
finer edge and polish.&nbsp; His sarcasms are so subtly prepared
and so slily allusive, that they may often escape readers whose
sense of wit is not very acute; but for those who delight in the
subtle and delicate flavors of style, there can hardly be any wit
more irresistible than Heine&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We may measure its
force by the degree in which it has subdued the German language
to its purposes, and made that language brilliant in spite of a
long hereditary transmission of dulness.&nbsp; As one of the most
harmless examples of his satire, take this on a man who has
certainly had his share of adulation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Assuredly it is far from my purpose to
depreciate M. Victor Cousin.&nbsp; The titles of this celebrated
philosopher even lay me under an obligation to praise him.&nbsp;
He belongs to that living pantheon of France which we call the
peerage, and his intelligent legs rest on the velvet benches of
the Luxembourg.&nbsp; I must indeed sternly repress all private
feelings which might seduce me into an excessive
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Otherwise I might be suspected of servility;
for M. Cousin is very influential in the State by means of his
position and his tongue.&nbsp; This consideration might even move
me to speak of his faults as frankly as of his virtues.&nbsp;
Will he himself disapprove of this?&nbsp; Assuredly not.&nbsp; I
know that we cannot do higher honor to great minds than when we
throw as strong a light on their demerits as on their
merits.&nbsp; When we sing the praises of a Hercules, we must
also mention that he once laid aside the lion&rsquo;s skin and
sat down to the distaff: what then? he remains notwithstanding a
Hercules!&nbsp; So when we relate similar circumstances
concerning M. Cousin, we <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>must
nevertheless add, with discriminating eulogy: <i>M. Cousin</i>,
<i>if he has sometimes sat twaddling at the distaff</i>, <i>has
never laid aside the lion&rsquo;s skin</i>. . . . It is true
that, having been suspected of demagogy, he spent some time in a
German prison, just as Lafayette and Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion.&nbsp; But that M. Cousin there in his leisure hours studied
Kant&rsquo;s &lsquo;Critique of Pure Reason&rsquo; is to be
doubted on three grounds.&nbsp; First, this book is written in
German.&nbsp; Secondly, in order to read this book, a man must
understand German.&nbsp; Thirdly, M. Cousin does not understand
German. . . . I fear I am passing unawares from the sweet waters
of praise into the bitter ocean of blame.&nbsp; Yes, on one
account I cannot refrain from bitterly blaming M.
Cousin&mdash;namely, that he who loves truth far more than he
loves Plato and Tenneman is unjust to himself when he wants to
persuade us that he has borrowed something from the philosophy of
Schelling and Hegel.&nbsp; Against this self-accusation I must
take M. Cousin under my protection.&nbsp; On my word and
conscience! this honorable man has not stolen a jot from
Schelling and Hegel, and if he brought home anything of theirs,
it was merely their friendship.&nbsp; That does honor to his
heart.&nbsp; But there are many instances of such false
self-accusation in psychology.&nbsp; I knew a man who declared
that he had stolen silver spoons at the king&rsquo;s table; and
yet we all knew that the poor devil had never been presented at
court, and accused himself of stealing these spoons to make us
believe that he had been a guest at the palace.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
In German philosophy M. Cousin has always kept the sixth
commandment; here he has never pocketed a single idea, not so
much as a salt-spoon of an idea.&nbsp; All witnesses agree in
attesting that in this respect M. Cousin is honor itself. . .
.&nbsp; I prophesy to you that the renown of M. Cousin, like the
French Revolution, will go round the world!&nbsp; I hear some one
wickedly add: Undeniably the renown of M. Cousin is going round
the world, and <i>it has already taken its departure from
France</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following &ldquo;symbolical myth&rdquo; about Louis
Philippe is very characteristic of Heine&rsquo;s manner:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I remember very well that immediately on my
arrival (in Paris) I hastened to the Palais Royal to see Louis
Philippe.&nbsp; The friend who conducted me told me that the king
now appeared on the terrace only at stated hours, but that
formerly he was to be seen at any time for five francs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For five francs!&rsquo; I cried with amazement;
&lsquo;does he then show himself for money?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, but he is shown for money, and it happens in this way:
There is a society of <i>claqueurs</i>, <i>marchands de
contremarques</i>, and such riff-raff, who offered every <!--
page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>foreigner to show him the king for five francs: if he
would give ten francs, he might see the king raise his eyes to
heaven, and lay his hand protestingly on his heart; if he would
give twenty francs, the king would sing the Marseillaise.&nbsp;
If the foreigner gave five francs, they raised a loud cheering
under the king&rsquo;s windows, and His Majesty appeared on the
terrace, bowed, and retired.&nbsp; If ten francs, they shouted
still louder, and gesticulated as if they had been possessed,
when the king appeared, who then, as a sign of silent emotion,
raised his eyes to heaven and laid his hand on his heart.&nbsp;
English visitors, however, would sometimes spend as much as
twenty francs, and then the enthusiasm mounted to the highest
pitch; no sooner did the king appear on the terrace than the
Marseillaise was struck up and roared out frightfully, until
Louis Philippe, perhaps only for the sake of putting an end to
the singing, bowed, laid his hand on his heart, and joined in the
Marseillaise.&nbsp; Whether, as is asserted, he beat time with
his foot, I cannot say.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more quotation, and it must be our last:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh the women!&nbsp; We must forgive them
much, for they love much&mdash;and many.&nbsp; Their hate is
properly only love turned inside out.&nbsp; Sometimes they
attribute some delinquency to us, because they think they can in
this way gratify another man.&nbsp; When they write, they have
always one eye on the paper and the other on a man; and this is
true of all authoresses, except the Countess Hahn-Hahn, who has
only one eye.&rdquo;</p>

GERMAN LIFE. <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"

<p>It is an interesting branch of psychological observation to
note the images that are habitually associated with abstract or
collective terms&mdash;what may be called the picture-writing of
the mind, which it carries on concurrently with the more subtle
symbolism of language.&nbsp; Perhaps the fixity or variety of
these associated images would furnish a tolerably fair test of
the amount of concrete knowledge and experience which a given
word represents, in the minds of two persons who use it with
equal familiarity.&nbsp; The word <i>railways</i>, for example,
will probably call up, in the mind of a man who is not highly
locomotive, the image either of a &ldquo;Bradshaw,&rdquo; or of
the station with which he is most familiar, or of an indefinite
length of tram-road; he will alternate between these three
images, which represent his stock of concrete acquaintance with
railways.&nbsp; But suppose a man to have had successively the
experience of a &ldquo;navvy,&rdquo; an engineer, a traveller, a
railway director and shareholder, and a landed proprietor in
treaty with a railway company, and it is probable that the range
of images which would by turns present themselves to his mind at
the mention of the <i>word</i> &ldquo;railways,&rdquo; would
include all the essential facts in the existence and relations of
the <i>thing</i>.&nbsp; Now it is possible for the
first-mentioned personage to entertain very expanded views as to
the multiplication of railways in the abstract, and their
ultimate function in civilization.&nbsp; He may talk of a vast
<!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>network of railways stretching over the globe, of
future &ldquo;lines&rdquo; in Madagascar, and elegant
refreshment-rooms in the Sandwich Islands, with none the less
glibness because his distinct conceptions on the subject do not
extend beyond his one station and his indefinite length of
tram-road.&nbsp; But it is evident that if we want a railway to
be made, or its affairs to be managed, this man of wide views and
narrow observation will not serve our purpose.</p>
<p>Probably, if we could ascertain the images called up by the
terms &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; &ldquo;the masses,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the proletariat,&rdquo; &ldquo;the peasantry,&rdquo; by
many who theorize on those bodies with eloquence, or who
legislate without eloquence, we should find that they indicate
almost as small an amount of concrete knowledge&mdash;that they
are as far from completely representing the complex facts summed
up in the collective term, as the railway images of our
non-locomotive gentleman.&nbsp; How little the real
characteristics of the working-classes are known to those who are
outside them, how little their natural history has been studied,
is sufficiently disclosed by our Art as well as by our political
and social theories.&nbsp; Where, in our picture exhibitions,
shall we find a group of true peasantry?&nbsp; What English
artist even attempts to rival in truthfulness such studies of
popular life as the pictures of Teniers or the ragged boys of
Murillo?&nbsp; Even one of the greatest painters of the
pre-eminently realistic school, while, in his picture of
&ldquo;The Hireling Shepherd,&rdquo; he gave us a landscape of
marvellous truthfulness, placed a pair of peasants in the
foreground who were not much more real than the idyllic swains
and damsels of our chimney ornaments.&nbsp; Only a total absence
of acquaintance and sympathy with our peasantry could give a
moment&rsquo;s popularity to such a picture as &ldquo;Cross
Purposes,&rdquo; where we have a peasant girl who looks as if she
knew L. E. L.&rsquo;s poems by heart, and English rustics, whose
costume seems to indicate that they are meant for ploughmen, with
exotic features that remind us of a handsome <i>primo
tenore</i>.&nbsp; Rather than such cockney sentimentality as
this, as an education for the taste and sympathies, we <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>prefer the most crapulous group of boors that Teniers
ever painted.&nbsp; But even those among our painters who aim at
giving the rustic type of features, who are far above the
effeminate feebleness of the &ldquo;Keepsake&rdquo; style, treat
their subjects under the influence of traditions and
prepossessions rather than of direct observation.&nbsp; The
notion that peasants are joyous, that the typical moment to
represent a man in a smock-frock is when he is cracking a joke
and showing a row of sound teeth, that cottage matrons are
usually buxom, and village children necessarily rosy and merry,
are prejudices difficult to dislodge from the artistic mind,
which looks for its subjects into literature instead of
life.&nbsp; The painter is still under the influence of idyllic
literature, which has always expressed the imagination of the
cultivated and town-bred, rather than the truth of rustic
life.&nbsp; Idyllic ploughmen are jocund when they drive their
team afield; idyllic shepherds make bashful love under hawthorn
bushes; idyllic villagers dance in the checkered shade and
refresh themselves, not immoderately, with spicy nut-brown
ale.&nbsp; But no one who has seen much of actual ploughmen
thinks them jocund; no one who is well acquainted with the
English peasantry can pronounce them merry.&nbsp; The slow gaze,
in which no sense of beauty beams, no humor twinkles, the slow
utterance, and the heavy, slouching walk, remind one rather of
that melancholy animal the camel than of the sturdy countryman,
with striped stockings, red waistcoat, and hat aside, who
represents the traditional English peasant.&nbsp; Observe a
company of haymakers.&nbsp; When you see them at a distance,
tossing up the forkfuls of hay in the golden light, while the
wagon creeps slowly with its increasing burden over the meadow,
and the bright green space which tells of work done gets larger
and larger, you pronounce the scene &ldquo;smiling,&rdquo; and
you think these companions in labor must be as bright and
cheerful as the picture to which they give animation.&nbsp;
Approach nearer, and you will certainly find that haymaking time
is a time for joking, especially if there are women among the
laborers; but the coarse laugh that bursts out every now and
then, and expresses <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the triumphant taunt, is as far as
possible from your conception of idyllic merriment.&nbsp; That
delicious effervescence of the mind which we call fun has no
equivalent for the northern peasant, except tipsy revelry; the
only realm of fancy and imagination for the English clown exists
at the bottom of the third quart pot.</p>
<p>The conventional countryman of the stage, who picks up
pocket-books and never looks into them, and who is too simple
even to know that honesty has its opposite, represents the still
lingering mistake, that an unintelligible dialect is a guarantee
for ingenuousness, and that slouching shoulders indicate an
upright disposition.&nbsp; It is quite true that a thresher is
likely to be innocent of any adroit arithmetical cheating, but he
is not the less likely to carry home his master&rsquo;s corn in
his shoes and pocket; a reaper is not given to writing
begging-letters, but he is quite capable of cajoling the
dairymaid into filling his small-beer bottle with ale.&nbsp; The
selfish instincts are not subdued by the sight of buttercups, nor
is integrity in the least established by that classic rural
occupation, sheep-washing.&nbsp; To make men moral something more
is requisite than to turn them out to grass.</p>
<p>Opera peasants, whose unreality excites Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s
indignation, are surely too frank an idealization to be
misleading; and since popular chorus is one of the most effective
elements of the opera, we can hardly object to lyric rustics in
elegant laced boddices and picturesque motley, unless we are
prepared to advocate a chorus of colliers in their pit costume,
or a ballet of charwomen and stocking-weavers.&nbsp; But our
social novels profess to represent the people as they are, and
the unreality of their representations is a grave evil.&nbsp; The
greatest benefit we owe to the artist, whether painter, poet, or
novelist, is the extension of our sympathies.&nbsp; Appeals
founded on generalizations and statistics require a sympathy
ready-made, a moral sentiment already in activity; but a picture
of human life such as a great artist can give, surprises even the
trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is a part
from themselves, <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>which may be called the raw material
of moral sentiment.&nbsp; When Scott takes us into Luckie
Mucklebackit&rsquo;s cottage, or tells the story of &ldquo;The
Two Drovers;&rdquo; when Wordsworth sings to us the reverie of
&ldquo;Poor Susan;&rdquo; when Kingsley shows us Alton Locke
gazing yearningly over the gate which leads from the highway into
the first wood he ever saw; when Hornung paints a group of
chimney-sweepers&mdash;more is done toward linking the higher
classes with the lower, toward obliterating the vulgarity of
exclusiveness, than by hundreds of sermons and philosophical
dissertations.&nbsp; Art is the nearest thing to life; it is a
mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our
fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.&nbsp; All the
more sacred is the task of the artist when he undertakes to paint
the life of the People.&nbsp; Falsification here is far more
pernicious than in the more artificial aspects of life.&nbsp; It
is not so very serious that we should have false ideas about
evanescent fashions&mdash;about the manners and conversation of
beaux and duchesses; but it <i>is</i> serious that our sympathy
with the perennial joys and struggles, the toil, the tragedy, and
the humor in the life of our more heavily laden fellow-men,
should be perverted, and turned toward a false object instead of
the true one.</p>
<p>This perversion is not the less fatal because the
misrepresentation which give rise to it has what the artist
considers a moral end.&nbsp; The thing for mankind to know is,
not what are the motives and influences which the moralist thinks
<i>ought</i> to act on the laborer or the artisan, but what are
the motives and influences which <i>do</i> act on him.&nbsp; We
want to be taught to feel, not for the heroic artisan or the
sentimental peasant, but for the peasant in all his coarse
apathy, and the artisan in all his suspicious selfishness.</p>
<p>We have one great novelist who is gifted with the utmost power
of rendering the external traits of our town population; and if
he could give us their psychological character&mdash;their
conception of life, and their emotions&mdash;with the same truth
as their idiom and manners, his books would be the greatest
contribution <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Art has ever made to the awakening
of social sympathies.&nbsp; But while he can copy Mrs.
Plornish&rsquo;s colloquial style with the delicate accuracy of a
sun-picture, while there is the same startling inspiration in his
description of the gestures and phrases of &ldquo;Boots,&rdquo;
as in the speeches of Shakespeare&rsquo;s mobs or numskulls, he
scarcely ever passes from the humorous and external to the
emotional and tragic, without becoming as transcendent in his
unreality as he was a moment before in his artistic
truthfulness.&nbsp; But for the precious salt of his humor, which
compels him to reproduce external traits that serve in some
degree as a corrective to his frequently false psychology, his
preternaturally virtuous poor children and artisans, his
melodramatic boatmen and courtesans, would be as obnoxious as
Eug&egrave;ne Sue&rsquo;s idealized proletaires, in encouraging
the miserable fallacy that high morality and refined sentiment
can grow out of harsh social relations, ignorance, and want; or
that the working-classes are in a condition to enter at once into
a millennial state of <i>altruism</i>, wherein every one is
caring for everyone else, and no one for himself.</p>
<p>If we need a true conception of the popular character to guide
our sympathies rightly, we need it equally to check our theories,
and direct us in their application.&nbsp; The tendency created by
the splendid conquests of modern generalization, to believe that
all social questions are merged in economical science, and that
the relations of men to their neighbors may be settled by
algebraic equations&mdash;the dream that the uncultured classes
are prepared for a condition which appeals principally to their
moral sensibilities&mdash;the aristocractic dilettantism which
attempts to restore the &ldquo;good old times&rdquo; by a sort of
idyllic masquerading, and to grow feudal fidelity and veneration
as we grow prize turnips, by an artificial system of
culture&mdash;none of these diverging mistakes can coexist with a
real knowledge of the people, with a thorough study of their
habits, their ideas, their motives.&nbsp; The landholder, the
clergyman, the mill-owner, the mining-agent, have each an
opportunity for making precious observations on different
sections <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of the working-classes, but
unfortunately their experience is too often not registered at
all, or its results are too scattered to be available as a source
of information and stimulus to the public mind generally.&nbsp;
If any man of sufficient moral and intellectual breadth, whose
observations would not be vitiated by a foregone conclusion, or
by a professional point of view, would devote himself to studying
the natural history of our social classes, especially of the
small shopkeepers, artisans, and peasantry&mdash;the degree in
which they are influenced by local conditions, their maxims and
habits, the points of view from which they regard their religions
teachers, and the degree in which they are influenced by
religious doctrines, the interaction of the various classes on
each other, and what are the tendencies in their position toward
disintegration or toward development&mdash;and if, after all this
study, he would give us the result of his observation in a book
well nourished with specific facts, his work would be a valuable
aid to the social and political reformer.</p>
<p>What we are desiring for ourselves has been in some degree
done for the Germans by Riehl, the author of the very remarkable
books, the titles of which are placed at the head of this
article; and we wish to make these books known to our readers,
not only for the sake of the interesting matter they contain, and
the important reflections they suggest, but also as a model for
some future or actual student of our own people.&nbsp; By way of
introducing Riehl to those who are unacquainted with his
writings, we will give a rapid sketch from his picture of the
German Peasantry, and perhaps this indication of the mode in
which he treats a particular branch of his subject may prepare
them to follow us with more interest when we enter on the general
purpose and contents of his works.</p>
<p>In England, at present, when we speak of the peasantry we mean
scarcely more than the class of farm-servants and farm-laborers;
and it is only in the most primitive districts, as in Wales, for
example, that farmers are included under the term.&nbsp; In order
to appreciate what Riehl says of the German peasantry, <!-- page
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>we
must remember what the tenant-farmers and small proprietors were
in England half a century ago, when the master helped to milk his
own cows, and the daughters got up at one o&rsquo;clock in the
morning to brew&mdash;when the family dined in the kitchen with
the servants, and sat with them round the kitchen fire, in the
evening.&nbsp; In those days, the quarried parlor was innocent of
a carpet, and its only specimens of art were a framed sampler and
the best tea-board; the daughters even of substantial farmers had
often no greater accomplishment in writing and spelling than they
could procure at a dame-school; and, instead of carrying on
sentimental correspondence, they were spinning their future
table-linen, and looking after every saving in butter and eggs
that might enable them to add to the little stock of plate and
china which they were laying in against their marriage.&nbsp; In
our own day, setting aside the superior order of farmers, whose
style of living and mental culture are often equal to that of the
professional class in provincial towns, we can hardly enter the
least imposing farm-house without finding a bad piano in the
&ldquo;drawing-room,&rdquo; and some old annuals, disposed with a
symmetrical imitation of negligence, on the table; though the
daughters may still drop their <i>h&rsquo;s</i>, their vowels are
studiously narrow; and it is only in very primitive regions that
they will consent to sit in a covered vehicle without springs,
which was once thought an advance in luxury on the pillion.</p>
<p>The condition of the tenant-farmers and small proprietors in
Germany is, we imagine, about on a par, not, certainly, in
material prosperity, but in mental culture and habits, with that
of the English farmers who were beginning to be thought
old-fashioned nearly fifty years ago, and if we add to these the
farm servants and laborers we shall have a class approximating in
its characteristics to the <i>Bauernthum</i>, or peasantry,
described by Riehl.</p>
<p>In Germany, perhaps more than in any other country, it is
among the peasantry that we must look for the historical type of
the national <i>physique</i>.&nbsp; In the towns this type has
become <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>so modified to express the
personality of the individual that even &ldquo;family
likeness&rdquo; is often but faintly marked.&nbsp; But the
peasants may still be distinguished into groups, by their
physical peculiarities.&nbsp; In one part of the country we find
a longer-legged, in another a broader-shouldered race, which has
inherited these peculiarities for centuries.&nbsp; For example,
in certain districts of Hesse are seen long faces, with high
foreheads, long, straight noses, and small eyes, with arched
eyebrows and large eyelids.&nbsp; On comparing these
physiognomies with the sculptures in the church of St. Elizabeth,
at Marburg, executed in the thirteenth century, it will be found
that the same old Hessian type of face has subsisted unchanged,
with this distinction only, that the sculptures represent princes
and nobles, whose features then bore the stamp of their race,
while that stamp is now to be found only among the
peasants.&nbsp; A painter who wants to draw medi&aelig;val
characters with historic truth must seek his models among the
peasantry.&nbsp; This explains why the old German painters gave
the heads of their subjects a greater uniformity of type than the
painters of our day; the race had not attained to a high degree
of individualization in features and expression.&nbsp; It
indicates, too, that the cultured man acts more as an individual,
the peasant more as one of a group.&nbsp; Hans drives the plough,
lives, and thinks, just as Kunz does; and it is this fact that
many thousands of men are as like each other in thoughts and
habits as so many sheep or oysters, which constitutes the weight
of the peasantry in the social and political scale.</p>
<p>In the cultivated world each individual has his style of
speaking and writing.&nbsp; But among the peasantry it is the
race, the district, the province, that has its
style&mdash;namely, its dialect, its phraseology, its proverbs,
and its songs, which belong alike to the entire body of the
people.&nbsp; This provincial style of the peasant is again, like
his <i>physique</i>, a remnant of history, to which he clings
with the utmost tenacity.&nbsp; In certain parts of Hungary there
are still descendants of German colonists of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, who go about <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>the country
as reapers, retaining their old Saxon songs and manners, while
the more cultivated German emigrants in a very short time forget
their own language, and speak Hungarian.&nbsp; Another remarkable
case of the same kind is that of the Wends, a Slavonic race
settled in Lusatia, whose numbers amount to 200,000, living
either scattered among the German population or in separate
parishes.&nbsp; They have their own schools and churches, and are
taught in the Slavonic tongue.&nbsp; The Catholics among them are
rigid adherents of the Pope; the Protestants not less rigid
adherents of Luther, or <i>Doctor</i> Luther, as they are
particular in calling him&mdash;a custom which a hundred years
ago was universal in Protestant Germany.&nbsp; The Wend clings
tenaciously to the usages of his Church, and perhaps this may
contribute not a little to the purity in which he maintains the
specific characteristics of his race.&nbsp; German education,
German law and government, service in the standing army, and many
other agencies, are in antagonism to his national exclusiveness;
but the <i>wives</i> and <i>mothers</i> here, as elsewhere, are a
conservative influence, and the habits temporarily laid aside in
the outer world are recovered by the fireside.&nbsp; The Wends
form several stout regiments in the Saxon army; they are sought
far and wide, as diligent and honest servants; and many a weakly
Dresden or Leipzig child becomes thriving under the care of a
Wendish nurse.&nbsp; In their villages they have the air and
habits of genuine sturdy peasants, and all their customs indicate
that they have been from the first an agricultural people.&nbsp;
For example, they have traditional modes of treating their
domestic animals.&nbsp; Each cow has its own name, generally
chosen carefully, so as to express the special qualities of the
animal; and all important family events are narrated to the
<i>bees</i>&mdash;a custom which is found also in
Westphalia.&nbsp; Whether by the help of the bees or not, the
Wend farming is especially prosperous; and when a poor Bohemian
peasant has a son born to him he binds him to the end of a long
pole and turns his face toward Lusatia, that he may be as lucky
as the Wends, who live there.</p>
<p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>The peculiarity of the peasant&rsquo;s language
consists chiefly in his retention of historical peculiarities,
which gradually disappear under the friction of cultivated
circles.&nbsp; He prefers any proper name that may be given to a
day in the calendar, rather than the abstract date, by which he
very rarely reckons.&nbsp; In the baptismal names of his children
he is guided by the old custom of the country, not at all by whim
and fancy.&nbsp; Many old baptismal names, formerly common in
Germany, would have become extinct but for their preservation
among the peasantry, especially in North Germany; and so firmly
have they adhered to local tradition in this matter that it would
be possible to give a sort of topographical statistics of proper
names, and distinguish a district by its rustic names as we do by
its Flora and Fauna.&nbsp; The continuous inheritance of certain
favorite proper names in a family, in some districts, forces the
peasant to adopt the princely custom of attaching a numeral to
the name, and saying, when three generations are living at once,
Hans I., II., and III.; or&mdash;in the more antique
fashion&mdash;Hans the elder, the middle, and the younger.&nbsp;
In some of our English counties there is a similar adherence to a
narrow range of proper names, and a mode of distinguishing
collateral branches in the same family, you will hear of
Jonathan&rsquo;s Bess, Thomas&rsquo;s Bess, and Samuel&rsquo;s
Bess&mdash;the three Bessies being cousins.</p>
<p>The peasant&rsquo;s adherence to the traditional has much
greater inconvenience than that entailed by a paucity of proper
names.&nbsp; In the Black Forest and in H&uuml;ttenberg you will
see him in the dog-days wearing a thick fur cap, because it is an
historical fur cap&mdash;a cap worn by his grandfather.&nbsp; In
the Wetterau, that peasant girl is considered the handsomest who
wears the most petticoats.&nbsp; To go to field-labor in seven
petticoats can be anything but convenient or agreeable, but it is
the traditionally correct thing, and a German peasant girl would
think herself as unfavorably conspicuous in an untraditional
costume as an English servant-girl would now think herself in a
&ldquo;linsey-wolsey&rdquo; apron or a thick muslin cap.&nbsp; In
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>many districts no medical advice would induce the
rustic to renounce the tight leather belt with which he injures
his digestive functions; you could more easily persuade him to
smile on a new communal system than on the unhistorical invention
of braces.&nbsp; In the eighteenth century, in spite of the
philanthropic preachers of potatoes, the peasant for years threw
his potatoes to the pigs and the dogs, before he could be
persuaded to put them on his own table.&nbsp; However, the
unwillingness of the peasant to adopt innovations has a not
unreasonable foundation in the fact that for him experiments are
practical, not theoretical, and must be made with expense of
money instead of brains&mdash;a fact that is not, perhaps,
sufficiently taken into account by agricultural theorists, who
complain of the farmer&rsquo;s obstinacy.&nbsp; The peasant has
the smallest possible faith in theoretic knowledge; he thinks it
rather dangerous than otherwise, as is well indicated by a Lower
Rhenish proverb&mdash;&ldquo;One is never too old to learn, said
an old woman; so she learned to be a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between many villages an historical feud, once perhaps the
occasion of much bloodshed, is still kept up under the milder
form of an occasional round of cudgelling and the launching of
traditional nicknames.&nbsp; An historical feud of this kind
still exists, for example, among many villages on the Rhine and
more inland places in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
<i>Rheinschnacke</i> (of which the equivalent is perhaps
&ldquo;water-snake&rdquo;) is the standing term of ignominy for
the inhabitant of the Rhine village, who repays it in kind by the
epithet &ldquo;karst&rdquo; (mattock), or &ldquo;kukuk&rdquo;
(cuckoo), according as the object of his hereditary hatred
belongs to the field or the forest.&nbsp; If any Romeo among the
&ldquo;mattocks&rdquo; were to marry a Juliet among the
&ldquo;water-snakes,&rdquo; there would be no lack of Tybalts and
Mercutios to carry the conflict from words to blows, though
neither side knows a reason for the enmity.</p>
<p>A droll instance of peasant conservatism is told of a village
on the Taunus, whose inhabitants, from time immemorial, had been
famous for impromptu cudgelling.&nbsp; For this historical <!--
page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>offence the magistrates of the district had always
inflicted the equally historical punishment of shutting up the
most incorrigible offenders, not in prison, but in their own
pig-sty.&nbsp; In recent times, however, the government, wishing
to correct the rudeness of these peasants, appointed an
&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; man as a magistrate, who at once
abolished the original penalty above mentioned.&nbsp; But this
relaxation of punishment was so far from being welcome to the
villagers that they presented a petition praying that a more
energetic man might be given them as a magistrate, who would have
the courage to punish according to law and justice, &ldquo;as had
been beforetime.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the magistrate who abolished
incarceration in the pig-sty could never obtain the respect of
the neighborhood.&nbsp; This happened no longer ago than the
beginning of the present century.</p>
<p>But it must not be supposed that the historical piety of the
German peasant extends to anything not immediately connected with
himself.&nbsp; He has the warmest piety toward the old
tumble-down house which his grandfather built, and which nothing
will induce him to improve, but toward the venerable ruins of the
old castle that overlooks his village he has no piety at all, and
carries off its stones to make a fence for his garden, or tears
down the gothic carving of the old monastic church, which is
&ldquo;nothing to him,&rdquo; to mark off a foot-path through his
field.&nbsp; It is the same with historical traditions.&nbsp; The
peasant has them fresh in his memory, so far as they relate to
himself.&nbsp; In districts where the peasantry are
unadulterated, you can discern the remnants of the feudal
relations in innumerable customs and phrases, but you will ask in
vain for historical traditions concerning the empire, or even
concerning the particular princely house to which the peasant is
subject.&nbsp; He can tell you what &ldquo;half people and whole
people&rdquo; mean; in Hesse you will still hear of &ldquo;four
horses making a whole peasant,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;four-day and
three-day peasants;&rdquo; but you will ask in vain about
Charlemagne and Frederic Barbarossa.</p>
<p>Riehl well observes that the feudal system, which made the
peasant the bondman of his lord, was an immense benefit in a <!--
page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>country, the greater part of which had still to be
colonized&mdash;rescued the peasant from vagabondage, and laid
the foundation of persistency and endurance in future
generations.&nbsp; If a free German peasantry belongs only to
modern times, it is to his ancestor who was a serf, and even, in
the earliest times, a slave, that the peasant owes the foundation
of his independence, namely, his capability of a settled
existence&mdash;nay, his unreasoning persistency, which has its
important function in the development of the race.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very worst result of that unreasoning persistency
is the peasant&rsquo;s inveterate habit of litigation.&nbsp;
Every one remembers the immortal description of Dandle
Dinmont&rsquo;s importunate application to Lawyer Pleydell to
manage his &ldquo;bit lawsuit,&rdquo; till at length Pleydell
consents to help him to ruin himself, on the ground that Dandle
may fall into worse hands.&nbsp; It seems this is a scene which
has many parallels in Germany.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s lawsuit
is his point of honor; and he will carry it through, though he
knows from the very first day that he shall get nothing by
it.&nbsp; The litigious peasant piques himself, like Mr.
Saddletree, on his knowledge of the law, and this vanity is the
chief impulse to many a lawsuit.&nbsp; To the mind of the
peasant, law presents itself as the &ldquo;custom of the
country,&rdquo; and it is his pride to be versed in all
customs.&nbsp; <i>Custom with him holds the place of
sentiment</i>, <i>of theory</i>, <i>and in many cases of
affection</i>.&nbsp; Riehl justly urges the importance of
simplifying law proceedings, so as to cut off this vanity at its
source, and also of encouraging, by every possible means, the
practice of arbitration.</p>
<p>The peasant never begins his lawsuit in summer, for the same
reason that he does not make love and marry in
summer&mdash;because he has no time for that sort of thing.&nbsp;
Anything is easier to him than to move out of his habitual
course, and he is attached even to his privations.&nbsp; Some
years ago a peasant youth, out of the poorest and remotest region
of the Westerwald, was enlisted as a recruit, at Weilburg in
Nassau.&nbsp; The lad, having never in his life slept in a bed,
when he had got <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>into one for the first time began to
cry like a child; and he deserted twice because he could not
reconcile himself to sleeping in a bed, and to the
&ldquo;fine&rdquo; life of the barracks: he was homesick at the
thought of his accustomed poverty and his thatched hut.&nbsp; A
strong contrast, this, with the feeling of the poor in towns, who
would be far enough from deserting because their condition was
too much improved!&nbsp; The genuine peasant is never ashamed of
his rank and calling; he is rather inclined to look down on every
one who does not wear a smock frock, and thinks a man who has the
manners of the gentry is likely to be rather windy and
unsubstantial.&nbsp; In some places, even in French districts,
this feeling is strongly symbolized by the practice of the
peasantry, on certain festival days, to dress the images of the
saints in peasant&rsquo;s clothing.&nbsp; History tells us of all
kinds of peasant insurrections, the object of which was to obtain
relief for the peasants from some of their many oppressions; but
of an effort on their part to step out of their hereditary rank
and calling, to become gentry, to leave the plough and carry on
the easier business of capitalists or government functionaries,
there is no example.</p>
<p>The German novelists who undertake to give pictures of
peasant-life fall into the same mistake as our English novelists:
they transfer their own feelings to ploughmen and woodcutters,
and give them both joys and sorrows of which they know
nothing.&nbsp; The peasant never questions the obligation of
family ties&mdash;he questions <i>no custom</i>&mdash;but tender
affection, as it exists among the refined part of mankind, is
almost as foreign to him as white hands and filbert-shaped
nails.&nbsp; That the aged father who has given up his property
to his children on condition of their maintaining him for the
remainder of his life, is very far from meeting with delicate
attentions, is indicated by the proverb current among the
peasantry&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take your clothes off before
you go to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among rustic moral tales and
parables, not one is more universal than the story of the
ungrateful children, who made their gray-headed father, dependent
on them for a maintenance, eat at a wooden trough <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>became he shook the food out of his trembling
hands.&nbsp; Then these same ungrateful children observed one day
that their own little boy was making a tiny wooden trough; and
when they asked him what it was for, he answered&mdash;that his
father and mother might eat out of it, when he was a man and had
to keep them.</p>
<p>Marriage is a very prudential affair, especially among the
peasants who have the largest share of property.&nbsp; Politic
marriages are as common among them as among princes; and when a
peasant-heiress in Westphalia marries, her husband adopts her
name, and places his own after it with the prefix <i>geborner</i>
(<i>n&eacute;e</i>).&nbsp; The girls marry young, and the
rapidity with which they get old and ugly is one among the many
proofs that the early years of marriage are fuller of hardships
than of conjugal tenderness.&nbsp; &ldquo;When our writers of
village stories,&rdquo; says Riehl, &ldquo;transferred their own
emotional life to the peasant, they obliterated what is precisely
his most predominant characteristic, namely, that with him
general custom holds the place of individual feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We pay for greater emotional susceptibility too often by
nervous diseases of which the peasant knows nothing.&nbsp; To him
headache is the least of physical evils, because he thinks
head-work the easiest and least indispensable of all labor.&nbsp;
Happily, many of the younger sons in peasant families, by going
to seek their living in the towns, carry their hardy nervous
system to amalgamate with the overwrought nerves of our town
population, and refresh them with a little rude vigor.&nbsp; And
a return to the habits of peasant life is the best remedy for
many moral as well as physical diseases induced by perverted
civilization.&nbsp; Riehl points to colonization as presenting
the true field for this regenerative process.&nbsp; On the other
side of the ocean a man will have the courage to begin life again
as a peasant, while at home, perhaps, opportunity as well as
courage will fail him.&nbsp; <i>Apropos</i> of this subject of
emigration, he remarks the striking fact, that the native
shrewdness and mother-wit of the German peasant seem to forsake
him entirely when he has to apply <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>them under
new circumstances, and on relations foreign to his
experience.&nbsp; Hence it is that the German peasant who
emigrates, so constantly falls a victim to unprincipled
adventurers in the preliminaries to emigration; but if once he
gets his foot on the American soil he exhibits all the first-rate
qualities of an agricultural colonist; and among all German
emigrants the peasant class are the most successful.</p>
<p>But many disintegrating forces have been at work on the
peasant character, and degeneration is unhappily going on at a
greater pace than development.&nbsp; In the wine districts
especially, the inability of the small proprietors to bear up
under the vicissitudes of the market, or to insure a high quality
of wine by running the risks of a late vintage and the
competition of beer and cider with the inferior wines, have
tended to produce that uncertainty of gain which, with the
peasant, is the inevitable cause of demoralization.&nbsp; The
small peasant proprietors are not a new class in Germany, but
many of the evils of their position are new.&nbsp; They are more
dependent on ready money than formerly; thus, where a peasant
used to get his wood for building and firing from the common
forest, he has now to pay for it with hard cash; he used to
thatch his own house, with the help perhaps of a neighbor, but
now he pays a man to do it for him; he used to pay taxes in kind,
he now pays them in money.&nbsp; The chances of the market have
to be discounted, and the peasant falls into the hands of
money-lenders.&nbsp; Here is one of the cases in which social
policy clashes with a purely economical policy.</p>
<p>Political vicissitudes have added their influence to that of
economical changes in disturbing that dim instinct, that
reverence for traditional custom, which is the peasant&rsquo;s
principle of action.&nbsp; He is in the midst of novelties for
which he knows no reason&mdash;changes in political geography,
changes of the government to which he owes fealty, changes in
bureaucratic management and police regulations.&nbsp; He finds
himself in a new element before an apparatus for breathing in it
is developed in him.&nbsp; His only knowledge of modern history
is <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>in some of its results&mdash;for instance, that he has
to pay heavier taxes from year to year.&nbsp; His chief idea of a
government is of a power that raises his taxes, opposes his
harmless customs, and torments him with new formalities.&nbsp;
The source of all this is the false system of
&ldquo;enlightening&rdquo; the peasant which has been adopted by
the bureaucratic governments.&nbsp; A system which disregards the
traditions and hereditary attachments of the peasant, and appeals
only to a logical understanding which is not yet developed in
him, is simply disintegrating and ruinous to the peasant
character.&nbsp; The interference with the communal regulations
has been of this fatal character.&nbsp; Instead of endeavoring to
promote to the utmost the healthy life of the Commune, as an
organism the conditions of which are bound up with the historical
characteristics of the peasant, the bureaucratic plan of
government is bent on improvement by its patent machinery of
state-appointed functionaries and off-hand regulations in
accordance with modern enlightenment.&nbsp; The spirit of
communal exclusiveness&mdash;the resistance to the indiscriminate
establishment of strangers, is an intense traditional feeling in
the peasant.&nbsp; &ldquo;This gallows is for us and our
children,&rdquo; is the typical motto of this spirit.&nbsp; But
such exclusiveness is highly irrational and repugnant to modern
liberalism; therefore a bureaucratic government at once opposes
it, and encourages to the utmost the introduction of new
inhabitants in the provincial communes.&nbsp; Instead of allowing
the peasants to manage their own affairs, and, if they happen to
believe that five and four make eleven, to unlearn the prejudice
by their own experience in calculation, so that they may
gradually understand processes, and not merely see results,
bureaucracy comes with its &ldquo;Ready Reckoner&rdquo; and works
all the peasant&rsquo;s sums for him&mdash;the surest way of
maintaining him in his stupidity, however it may shake his
prejudice.</p>
<p>Another questionable plan for elevating the peasant is the
supposed elevation of the clerical character by preventing the
clergyman from cultivating more than a trifling part of the land
attached to his benefice; that he may be as much as possible of
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>a scientific theologian, and as little as possible of a
peasant.&nbsp; In this, Riehl observes, lies one great source of
weakness to the Protestant Church as compared with the Catholic,
which finds the great majority of its priests among the lower
orders; and we have had the opportunity of making an analogous
comparison in England, where many of us can remember country
districts in which the great mass of the people were
christianized by illiterate Methodist and Independent ministers,
while the influence of the parish clergyman among the poor did
not extend much beyond a few old women in scarlet cloaks and a
few exceptional church-going laborers.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the general characteristics of the German
peasant, it is easy to understand his relation to the
revolutionary ideas and revolutionary movements of modern
times.&nbsp; The peasant, in Germany as elsewhere, is a born
grumbler.&nbsp; He has always plenty of grievances in his pocket,
but he does not generalize those grievances; he does not complain
of &ldquo;government&rdquo; or &ldquo;society,&rdquo; probably
because he has good reason to complain of the burgomaster.&nbsp;
When a few sparks from the first French Revolution fell among the
German peasantry, and in certain villages of Saxony the country
people assembled together to write down their demands, there was
no glimpse in their petition of the &ldquo;universal rights of
man,&rdquo; but simply of their own particular affairs as Saxon
peasants.&nbsp; Again, after the July revolution of 1830, there
were many insignificant peasant insurrections; but the object of
almost all was the removal of local grievances.&nbsp; Toll-houses
were pulled down; stamped paper was destroyed; in some places
there was a persecution of wild boars, in others, of that
plentiful tame animal, the German <i>Rath</i>, or councillor who
is never called into council.&nbsp; But in 1848 it seemed as if
the movements of the peasants had taken a new character; in the
small western states of Germany it seemed as if the whole class
of peasantry was in insurrection.&nbsp; But, in fact, the peasant
did not know the meaning of the part he was playing.&nbsp; He had
heard that everything was being set right in the towns, and that
wonderful things were happening <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>there, so
he tied up his bundle and set off.&nbsp; Without any distinct
object or resolution, the country people presented themselves on
the scene of commotion, and were warmly received by the party
leaders.&nbsp; But, seen from the windows of ducal palaces and
ministerial hotels, these swarms of peasants had quite another
aspect, and it was imagined that they had a common plan of
co-operation.&nbsp; This, however, the peasants have never
had.&nbsp; Systematic co-operation implies general conceptions,
and a provisional subordination of egoism, to which even the
artisans of towns have rarely shown themselves equal, and which
are as foreign to the mind of the peasant as logarithms or the
doctrine of chemical proportions.&nbsp; And the revolutionary
fervor of the peasant was soon cooled.&nbsp; The old mistrust of
the towns was reawakened on the spot.&nbsp; The Tyrolese peasants
saw no great good in the freedom of the press and the
constitution, because these changes &ldquo;seemed to please the
gentry so much.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peasants who had given their voices
stormily for a German parliament asked afterward, with a doubtful
look, whether it were to consist of infantry or cavalry.&nbsp;
When royal domains were declared the property of the State, the
peasants in some small principalities rejoiced over this, because
they interpreted it to mean that every one would have his share
in them, after the manner of the old common and forest
rights.</p>
<p>The very practical views of the peasants with regard to the
demands of the people were in amusing contrast with the abstract
theorizing of the educated townsmen.&nbsp; The peasant
continually withheld all State payments until he saw how matters
would turn out, and was disposed to reckon up the solid benefit,
in the form of land or money, that might come to him from the
changes obtained.&nbsp; While the townsman was heating his brains
about representation on the broadest basis, the peasant asked if
the relation between tenant and landlord would continue as
before, and whether the removal of the &ldquo;feudal
obligations&rdquo; meant that the farmer should become owner of
the land!</p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>It is in the same na&iuml;ve way that Communism is
interpreted by the German peasantry.&nbsp; The wide spread among
them of communistic doctrines, the eagerness with which they
listened to a plan for the partition of property, seemed to
countenance the notion that it was a delusion to suppose the
peasant would be secured from this intoxication by his love of
secure possession and peaceful earnings.&nbsp; But, in fact, the
peasant contemplated &ldquo;partition&rdquo; by the light of an
historical reminiscence rather than of novel theory.&nbsp; The
golden age, in the imagination of the peasant, was the time when
every member of the commune had a right to as much wood from the
forest as would enable him to sell some, after using what he
wanted in firing&mdash;in which the communal possessions were so
profitable that, instead of his having to pay rates at the end of
the year, each member of the commune was something in
pocket.&nbsp; Hence the peasants in general understood by
&ldquo;partition,&rdquo; that the State lands, especially the
forests, would be divided among the communes, and that, by some
political legerdemain or other, everybody would have free
fire-wood, free grazing for his cattle, and over and above that,
a piece of gold without working for it.&nbsp; That he should give
up a single clod of his own to further the general
&ldquo;partition&rdquo; had never entered the mind of the peasant
communist; and the perception that this was an essential
preliminary to &ldquo;partition&rdquo; was often a sufficient
cure for his Communism.</p>
<p>In villages lying in the neighborhood of large towns, however,
where the circumstances of the peasantry are very different,
quite another interpretation of Communism is prevalent.&nbsp;
Here the peasant is generally sunk to the position of the
proletaire living from hand to mouth: he has nothing to lose, but
everything to gain by &ldquo;partition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The coarse
nature of the peasant has here been corrupted into bestiality by
the disturbance of his instincts, while he is as yet incapable of
principles; and in this type of the degenerate peasant is seen
the worst example of ignorance intoxicated by theory.</p>
<p>A significant hint as to the interpretation the peasants put
<!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>on revolutionary theories may be drawn from the way
they employed the few weeks in which their movements were
unchecked.&nbsp; They felled the forest trees and shot the game;
they withheld taxes; they shook off the imaginary or real burdens
imposed on them by their mediatized princes, by presenting their
&ldquo;demands&rdquo; in a very rough way before the ducal or
princely &ldquo;Schloss;&rdquo; they set their faces against the
bureaucratic management of the communes, deposed the government
functionaries who had been placed over them as burgomasters and
magistrates, and abolished the whole bureaucratic system of
procedure, simply by taking no notice of its regulations, and
recurring to some tradition&mdash;some old order or disorder of
things.&nbsp; In all this it is clear that they were animated not
in the least by the spirit of modern revolution, but by a purely
narrow and personal impulse toward reaction.</p>
<p>The idea of constitutional government lies quite beyond the
range of the German peasant&rsquo;s conceptions.&nbsp; His only
notion of representation is that of a representation of
ranks&mdash;of classes; his only notion of a deputy is of one who
takes care, not of the national welfare, but of the interests of
his own order.&nbsp; Herein lay the great mistake of the
democratic party, in common with the bureaucratic governments,
that they entirely omitted the peculiar character of the peasant
from their political calculations.&nbsp; They talked of the
&ldquo;people&rdquo; and forgot that the peasants were included
in the term.&nbsp; Only a baseless misconception of the
peasant&rsquo;s character could induce the supposition that he
would feel the slightest enthusiasm about the principles involved
in the reconstitution of the Empire, or even about the
reconstitution itself.&nbsp; He has no zeal for a written law, as
such, but only so far as it takes the form of a living
law&mdash;a tradition.&nbsp; It was the external authority which
the revolutionary party had won in Baden that attracted the
peasants into a participation of the struggle.</p>
<p>Such, Riehl tells us, are the general characteristics of the
German peasantry&mdash;characteristics which subsist amid a wide
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>variety of circumstances.&nbsp; In Mecklenburg,
Pomerania, and Brandenburg the peasant lives on extensive
estates; in Westphalia he lives in large isolated homesteads; in
the Westerwald and in Sauerland, in little groups of villages and
hamlets; on the Rhine land is for the most part parcelled out
among small proprietors, who live together in large
villages.&nbsp; Then, of course, the diversified physical
geography of Germany gives rise to equally diversified methods of
land-culture; and out of these various circumstances grow
numerous specific differences in manner and character.&nbsp; But
the generic character of the German peasant is everywhere the
same; in the clean mountain hamlet and in the dirty fishing
village on the coast; in the plains of North Germany and in the
backwoods of America.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everywhere he has the same
historical character&mdash;everywhere custom is his supreme
law.&nbsp; Where religion and patriotism are still a na&iuml;ve
instinct, are still a sacred <i>custom</i>, there begins the
class of the German Peasantry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Our readers will perhaps already have gathered from the
foregoing portrait of the German peasant that Riehl is not a man
who looks at objects through the spectacles either of the
doctrinaire or the dreamer; and they will be ready to believe
what he tells us in his Preface, namely, that years ago he began
his wanderings over the hills and plains of Germany for the sake
of obtaining, in immediate intercourse with the people, that
completion of his historical, political, and economical studies
which he was unable to find in books.&nbsp; He began his
investigations with no party prepossessions, and his present
views were evolved entirely from his own gradually amassed
observations.&nbsp; He was, first of all, a pedestrian, and only
in the second place a political author.&nbsp; The views at which
he has arrived by this inductive process, he sums up in the
term&mdash;<i>social-political-conservatism</i>; but his
conservatism is, we conceive, of a thoroughly philosophical
kind.&nbsp; He sees in European society <i>incarnate history</i>,
and any attempt to disengage it from its historical elements
must, he believes, be simply destructive of <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>social
vitality. <a name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a>&nbsp; What has grown up historically
can only die out historically, by the gradual operation of
necessary laws.&nbsp; The external conditions which society has
inherited from the past are but the manifestation of inherited
internal conditions in the human beings who compose it; the
internal conditions and the external are related to each other as
the organism and its medium, and development can take place only
by the gradual consentaneous development of both.&nbsp; Take the
familiar example of attempts to abolish titles, which have been
about as effective as the process of cutting off poppy-heads in a
cornfield.&nbsp; <i>Jedem Menschem</i>, says Riehl, <i>ist sein
Zopf angeboren</i>, <i>warum soll denn der sociale Sprachgebrauch
nicht auch sein Zopf haben</i>?&mdash;which we may
render&mdash;&ldquo;As long as snobism runs in the blood, why
should it not run in our speech?&rdquo;&nbsp; As a necessary
preliminary to a purely rational society, you must obtain purely
rational men, free from the sweet and bitter prejudices of
hereditary affection and antipathy; which is as easy as to get
running streams without springs, or the leafy shade of the forest
without the secular growth of trunk and branch.</p>
<p>The historical conditions of society may be compared with
those of language.&nbsp; It must be admitted that the language of
cultivated nations is in anything but a rational state; the great
sections of the civilized world are only approximatively
intelligible to each other, and even that only at the cost of
long study; one word stands for many things, and many words for
one thing; the subtle shades of meaning, and still subtler echoes
of association, make language an instrument which scarcely
anything short of genius can wield with definiteness and
certainty.&nbsp; Suppose, then, that the effect which has been
again and again made to construct a universal language on a
rational basis has at length succeeded, and that you have a
language which has no uncertainty, no whims of idiom, no cumbrous
forms, no fitful simmer of many-hued significance, <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>no
hoary Archaisms &ldquo;familiar with forgotten
years&rdquo;&mdash;a patent deodorized and non-resonant language,
which effects the purpose of communication as perfectly and
rapidly as algebraic signs.&nbsp; Your language may be a perfect
medium of expression to science, but will never express
<i>life</i>, which is a great deal more than science.&nbsp; With
the anomalies and inconveniences of historical language you will
have parted with its music and its passions, and its vital
qualities as an expression of individual character, with its
subtle capabilities of wit, with everything that gives it power
over the imagination; and the next step in simplification will be
the invention of a talking watch, which will achieve the utmost
facility and despatch in the communication of ideas by a
graduated adjustment of ticks, to be represented in writing by a
corresponding arrangement of dots.&nbsp; A melancholy
&ldquo;language of the future!&rdquo;&nbsp; The sensory and motor
nerves that run in the same sheath are scarcely bound together by
a more necessary and delicate union than that which binds
men&rsquo;s affections, imagination, wit and humor, with the
subtle ramifications of historical language.&nbsp; Language must
be left to grow in precision, completeness, and unity, as minds
grow in clearness, comprehensiveness, and sympathy.&nbsp; And
there is an analogous relation between the moral tendencies of
men and the social conditions they have inherited.&nbsp; The
nature of European men has its roots intertwined with the past,
and can only be developed by allowing those roots to remain
undisturbed while the process of development is going on until
that perfect ripeness of the seed which carries with it a life
independent of the root.&nbsp; This vital connection with the
past is much more vividly felt on the Continent than in England,
where we have to recall it by an effort of memory and reflection;
for though our English life is in its core intensely traditional,
Protestantism and commerce have modernized the face of the land
and the aspects of society in a far greater degree than in any
continental country:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Abroad,&rdquo; says Ruskin, &ldquo;a
building of the eighth or tenth century stands ruinous in the
open streets; the children play round it, <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>the
peasants heap their corn in it, the buildings of yesterday nestle
about it, and fit their new stones in its rents, and tremble in
sympathy as it trembles.&nbsp; No one wonders at it, or thinks of
it as separate, and of another time; we feel the ancient world to
be a real thing; and one with the new; antiquity is no dream; it
is rather the children playing about the old stones that are the
dream.&nbsp; But all is continuous; and the words &ldquo;from
generation to generation&rdquo; understandable here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conception of European society as incarnate history is
the fundamental idea of Riehl&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; After the
notable failure of revolutionary attempts conducted from the
point of view of abstract democratic and socialistic theories,
after the practical demonstration of the evils resulting from a
bureaucratic system, which governs by an undiscriminating, dead
mechanism, Riehl wishes to urge on the consideration of his
countrymen a social policy founded on the special study of the
people as they are&mdash;on the natural history of the various
social ranks.&nbsp; He thinks it wise to pause a little from
theorizing, and see what is the material actually present for
theory to work upon.&nbsp; It is the glory of the
Socialists&mdash;in contrast with the democratic doctrinaires who
have been too much occupied with the general idea of &ldquo;the
people&rdquo; to inquire particularly into the actual life of the
people&mdash;that they have thrown themselves with enthusiastic
zeal into the study at least of one social group, namely, the
factory operatives; and here lies the secret of their partial
success.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, they have made this special
duty of a single fragment of society the basis of a theory which
quietly substitutes for the small group of Parisian proletaires
or English factory-workers the society of all Europe&mdash;nay,
of the whole world.&nbsp; And in this way they have lost the best
fruit of their investigations.&nbsp; For, says Riehl, the more
deeply we penetrate into the knowledge of society in its details,
the more thoroughly we shall be convinced that <i>a universal
social policy has no validity except on paper</i>, and can never
be carried into successful practice.&nbsp; The conditions of
German society are altogether different from those of French, of
English, or of Italian society; and to apply the same social
theory to these <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>nations indiscriminately is about as
wise a procedure as Triptolemus Yellowley&rsquo;s application of
the agricultural directions in Virgil&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Georgics&rdquo; to his farm in the Shetland Isles.</p>
<p>It is the clear and strong light in which Riehl places this
important position that in our opinion constitutes the suggestive
value of his books for foreign as well as German readers.&nbsp;
It has not been sufficiently insisted on, that in the various
branches of Social Science there is an advance from the general
to the special, from the simple to the complex, analogous with
that which is found in the series of the sciences, from
Mathematics to Biology.&nbsp; To the laws of quantity comprised
in Mathematics and Physics are superadded, in Chemistry, laws of
quality; to these again are added, in Biology, laws of life; and
lastly, the conditions of life in general branch out into its
special conditions, or Natural History, on the one hand, and into
its abnormal conditions, or Pathology, on the other.&nbsp; And in
this series or ramification of the sciences, the more general
science will not suffice to solve the problems of the more
special.&nbsp; Chemistry embraces phenomena which are not
explicable by Physics; Biology embraces phenomena which are not
explicable by Chemistry; and no biological generalization will
enable us to predict the infinite specialities produced by the
complexity of vital conditions.&nbsp; So Social Science, while it
has departments which in their fundamental generality correspond
to mathematics and physics, namely, those grand and simple
generalizations which trace out the inevitable march of the human
race as a whole, and, as a ramification of these, the laws of
economical science, has also, in the departments of government
and jurisprudence, which embrace the conditions of social life in
all their complexity, what may be called its Biology, carrying us
on to innumerable special phenomena which outlie the sphere of
science, and belong to Natural History.&nbsp; And just as the
most thorough acquaintance with physics, or chemistry, or general
physiology, will not enable you at once to establish the balance
of life in your private vivarium, so that your particular society
of zoophytes, mollusks, and echinoderms <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>may feel
themselves, as the Germans say, at ease in their skin; so the
most complete equipment of theory will not enable a statesman or
a political and social reformer to adjust his measures wisely, in
the absence of a special acquaintance with the section of society
for which he legislates, with the peculiar characteristics of the
nation, the province, the class whose well-being he has to
consult.&nbsp; In other words, a wise social policy must be based
not simply on abstract social science, but on the natural history
of social bodies.</p>
<p>Riehl&rsquo;s books are not dedicated merely to the
argumentative maintenance of this or of any other position; they
are intended chiefly as a contribution to that knowledge of the
German people on the importance of which he insists.&nbsp; He is
less occupied with urging his own conclusions than with
impressing on his readers the facts which have led him to those
conclusions.&nbsp; In the volume entitled &ldquo;Land und
Leute,&rdquo; which, though published last, is properly an
introduction to the volume entitled &ldquo;Die B&uuml;rgerliche
Gesellschaft,&rdquo; he considers the German people in their
physical geographical relations; he compares the natural
divisions of the race, as determined by land and climate, and
social traditions, with the artificial divisions which are based
on diplomacy; and he traces the genesis and influences of what we
may call the ecclesiastical geography of Germany&mdash;its
partition between Catholicism and Protestantism.&nbsp; He shows
that the ordinary antithesis of North and South Germany
represents no real ethnographical distinction, and that the
natural divisions of Germany, founded on its physical geography
are threefold&mdash;namely, the low plains, the middle mountain
region, and the high mountain region, or Lower, Middle, and Upper
Germany; and on this primary natural division all the other broad
ethnographical distinctions of Germany will be I found to
rest.&nbsp; The plains of North or Lower Germany include all the
seaboard the nation possesses; and this, together with the fact
that they are traversed to the depth of 600 miles by navigable
rivers, makes them the natural seat of a trading race.&nbsp;
Quite different is the geographical character of <!-- page
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Middle Germany.&nbsp; While the northern plains are
marked off into great divisions, by such rivers as the Lower
Rhine, the Weser, and the Oder, running almost in parallel lines,
this central region is cut up like a mosaic by the capricious
lines of valleys and rivers.&nbsp; Here is the region in which
you find those famous roofs from which the rain-water runs toward
two different seas, and the mountain-tops from which you may look
into eight or ten German states.&nbsp; The abundance of
water-power and the presence of extensive coal-mines allow of a
very diversified industrial development in Middle Germany.&nbsp;
In Upper Germany, or the high mountain region, we find the same
symmetry in the lines of the rivers as in the north; almost all
the great Alpine streams flow parallel with the Danube.&nbsp; But
the majority of these rivers are neither navigable nor available
for industrial objects, and instead of serving for communication
they shut off one great tract from another.&nbsp; The slow
development, the simple peasant life of many districts is here
determined by the mountain and the river.&nbsp; In the
south-east, however, industrial activity spreads through Bohemia
toward Austria, and forms a sort of balance to the industrial
districts of the Lower Rhine.&nbsp; Of course, the boundaries of
these three regions cannot be very strictly defined; but an
approximation to the limits of Middle Germany may be obtained by
regarding it as a triangle, of which one angle lies in Silesia,
another in Aix-la-Chapelle, and a third at Lake Constance.</p>
<p>This triple division corresponds with the broad distinctions
of climate.&nbsp; In the northern plains the atmosphere is damp
and heavy; in the southern mountain region it is dry and rare,
and there are abrupt changes of temperature, sharp contrasts
between the seasons, and devastating storms; but in both these
zones men are hardened by conflict with the roughness of the
climate.&nbsp; In Middle Germany, on the contrary, there is
little of this struggle; the seasons are more equable, and the
mild, soft air of the valleys tends to make the inhabitants
luxurious and sensitive to hardships.&nbsp; It is only in
exceptional mountain districts that one is here reminded of the
rough, bracing air on <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>the heights of Southern
Germany.&nbsp; It is a curious fact that, as the air becomes
gradually lighter and rarer from the North German coast toward
Upper Germany, the average of suicides regularly decreases.&nbsp;
Mecklenburg has the highest number, then Prussia, while the
fewest suicides occur in Bavaria and Austria.</p>
<p>Both the northern and southern regions have still a large
extent of waste lands, downs, morasses, and heaths; and to these
are added, in the south, abundance of snow-fields and naked rock;
while in Middle Germany culture has almost over-spread the face
of the land, and there are no large tracts of waste.&nbsp; There
is the same proportion in the distribution of forests.&nbsp;
Again, in the north we see a monotonous continuity of
wheat-fields, potato-grounds, meadow-lands, and vast heaths, and
there is the same uniformity of culture over large surfaces in
the southern table-lands and the Alpine pastures.&nbsp; In Middle
Germany, on the contrary, there is a perpetual variety of crops
within a short space; the diversity of land surface and the
corresponding variety in the species of plants are an invitation
to the splitting up of estates, and this again encourages to the
utmost the motley character of the cultivation.</p>
<p>According to this threefold division, it appears that there
are certain features common to North and South Germany in which
they differ from Central Germany, and the nature of this
difference Riehl indicates by distinguishing the former as
<i>Centralized Land</i> and the latter as <i>Individualized
Land</i>; a distinction which is well symbolized by the fact that
North and South Germany possess the great lines of railway which
are the medium for the traffic of the world, while Middle Germany
is far richer in lines for local communication, and possesses the
greatest length of railway within the smallest space.&nbsp;
Disregarding superficialities, the East Frieslanders, the
Schleswig-Holsteiners, the Mecklenburghers, and the Pomeranians
are much more nearly allied to the old Bavarians, the Tyrolese,
and the Styrians than any of these are allied to the Saxons, the
Thuringians, or the Rhinelanders.&nbsp; Both in North and <!--
page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>South Germany original races are still found in large
masses, and popular dialects are spoken; you still find there
thoroughly peasant districts, thorough villages, and also, at
great intervals, thorough cities; you still find there a sense of
rank.&nbsp; In Middle Germany, on the contrary, the original
races are fused together or sprinkled hither and thither; the
peculiarities of the popular dialects are worn down or confused;
there is no very strict line of demarkation between the country
and the town population, hundreds of small towns and large
villages being hardly distinguishable in their characteristics;
and the sense of rank, as part of the organic structure of
society, is almost extinguished.&nbsp; Again, both in the north
and south there is still a strong ecclesiastical spirit in the
people, and the Pomeranian sees Antichrist in the Pope as clearly
as the Tyrolese sees him in Doctor Luther; while in Middle
Germany the confessions are mingled, they exist peaceably side by
side in very narrow space, and tolerance or indifference has
spread itself widely even in the popular mind.&nbsp; And the
analogy, or rather the causal relation between the physical
geography of the three regions and the development of the
population goes still further:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; observes Riehl, &ldquo;the
striking connection which has been pointed out between the local
geological formations in Germany and the revolutionary
disposition of the people has more than a metaphorical
significance.&nbsp; Where the primeval physical revolutions of
the globe have been the wildest in their effects, and the most
multiform strata have been tossed together or thrown one upon the
other, it is a very intelligible consequence that on a land
surface thus broken up, the population should sooner develop
itself into small communities, and that the more intense life
generated in these smaller communities should become the most
favorable nidus for the reception of modern culture, and with
this a susceptibility for its revolutionary ideas; while a people
settled in a region where its groups are spread over a large
space will persist much more obstinately in the retention of its
original character.&nbsp; The people of Middle Germany have none
of that exclusive one-sidedness which determines the peculiar
genius of great national groups, just as this one-sidedness or
uniformity is wanting to the geological and geographical
character of their land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>This ethnographical outline Riehl fills up with special
and typical descriptions, and then makes it the starting-point
for a criticism of the actual political condition of
Germany.&nbsp; The volume is fall of vivid pictures, as well as
penetrating glances into the maladies and tendencies of modern
society.&nbsp; It would be fascinating as literature if it were
not important for its facts and philosophy.&nbsp; But we can only
commend it to our readers, and pass on to the volume entitled
&ldquo;Die B&uuml;rgerliche Gesellschaft,&rdquo; from which we
have drawn our sketch of the German peasantry.&nbsp; Here Riehl
gives us a series of studies in that natural history of the
people which he regards as the proper basis of social
policy.&nbsp; He holds that, in European society, there are
<i>three natural ranks or estates</i>: the hereditary landed
aristocracy, the citizens or commercial class, and the peasantry
or agricultural class.&nbsp; By <i>natural ranks</i> he means
ranks which have their roots deep in the historical structure of
society, and are still, in the present, showing vitality above
ground; he means those great social groups which are not only
distinguished externally by their vocation, but essentially by
their mental character, their habits, their mode of life&mdash;by
the principle they represent in the historical development of
society.&nbsp; In his conception of the &ldquo;Fourth
Estate&rdquo; he differs from the usual interpretation, according
to which it is simply equivalent to the Proletariat, or those who
are dependent on daily wages, whose only capital is their skill
or bodily strength&mdash;factory operatives, artisans,
agricultural laborers, to whom might be added, especially in
Germany, the day-laborers with the quill, the literary
proletariat.&nbsp; This, Riehl observes, is a valid basis of
economical classification, but not of social
classification.&nbsp; In his view, the Fourth Estate is a stratum
produced by the perpetual abrasion of the other great social
groups; it is the sign and result of the decomposition which is
commencing in the organic constitution of society.&nbsp; Its
elements are derived alike from the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie,
and the peasantry.&nbsp; It assembles under its banner the
deserters of historical society, and forms them into a terrible
army, <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>which is only just awaking to the
consciousness of its corporate power.&nbsp; The tendency of this
Fourth Estate, by the very process of its formation, is to do
away with the distinctive historical character of the other
estates, and to resolve their peculiar rank and vocation into a
uniform social relation founded on an abstract conception of
society.&nbsp; According to Riehl&rsquo;s classification, the
day-laborers, whom the political economist designates as the
Fourth Estate, belong partly to the peasantry or agricultural
class, and partly to the citizens or commercial class.</p>
<p>Riehl considers, in the first place, the peasantry and
aristocracy as the &ldquo;Forces of social persistence,&rdquo;
and, in the second, the bourgeoisie and the &ldquo;fourth
Estate&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Forces of social movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aristocracy, he observes, is the only one among these four
groups which is denied by others besides Socialists to have any
natural basis as a separate rank.&nbsp; It is admitted that there
was once an aristocracy which had an intrinsic ground of
existence, but now, it is alleged, this is an historical fossil,
an antiquarian relic, venerable because gray with age.&nbsp; It
what, it is asked, can consist the peculiar vocation of the
aristocracy, since it has no longer the monopoly of the land, of
the higher military functions, and of government offices, and
since the service of the court has no longer any political
importance?&nbsp; To this Riehl replies, that in great
revolutionary crises, the &ldquo;men of progress&rdquo; have more
than once &ldquo;abolished&rdquo; the aristocracy.&nbsp; But,
remarkably enough, the aristocracy has always reappeared.&nbsp;
This measure of abolition showed that the nobility were no longer
regarded as a real class, for to abolish a real class would be an
absurdity.&nbsp; It is quite possible to contemplate a voluntary
breaking up of the peasant or citizen class in the socialistic
sense, but no man in his senses would think of straightway
&ldquo;abolishing&rdquo; citizens and peasants.&nbsp; The
aristocracy, then, was regarded as a sort of cancer, or
excrescence of society.&nbsp; Nevertheless, not only has it been
found impossible to annihilate an hereditary nobility by decree,
but <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>also the aristocracy of the
eighteenth century outlived even the self-destructive acts of its
own perversity.&nbsp; A life which was entirely without object,
entirely destitute of functions, would not, says Riehl, be so
persistent.&nbsp; He has an acute criticism of those who conduct
a polemic against the idea of an hereditary aristocracy while
they are proposing an &ldquo;aristocracy of talent,&rdquo; which
after all is based on the principle of inheritance.&nbsp; The
Socialists are, therefore, only consistent in declaring against
an aristocracy of talent.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when they have turned
the world into a great Foundling Hospital they will still be
unable to eradicate the &lsquo;privileges of
birth.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; We must not follow him in his
criticism, however; nor can we afford to do more than mention
hastily his interesting sketch of the medi&aelig;val aristocracy,
and his admonition to the German aristocracy of the present day,
that the vitality of their class is not to be sustained by
romantic attempts to revive medi&aelig;val forms and sentiments,
but only by the exercise of functions as real and salutary for
actual society as those of the medi&aelig;val aristocracy were
for the feudal age.&nbsp; &ldquo;In modern society the divisions
of rank indicate <i>division of labor</i>, according to that
distribution of functions in the social organism which the
historical constitution of society has determined.&nbsp; In this
way the principle of differentiation and the principle of unity
are identical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elaborate study of the German bourgeoisie, which forms the
next division of the volume, must be passed over, but we may
pause a moment to note Riehl&rsquo;s definition of the social
<i>Philister</i> (Philistine), an epithet for which we have no
equivalent, not at all, however, for want of the object it
represents.&nbsp; Most people who read a little German know that
the epithet <i>Philister</i> originated in the
<i>Burschen-leben</i>, or Student-life of Germany, and that the
antithesis of <i>Bursch</i> and <i>Philister</i> was equivalent
to the antithesis of &ldquo;gown&rdquo; and &ldquo;town;&rdquo;
but since the word has passed into ordinary language it has
assumed several shades of significance which have not yet been
merged into a single, absolute meaning; and one of the questions
<!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>which an English visitor in Germany will probably take
an opportunity of asking is, &ldquo;What is the strict meaning of
the word <i>Philister</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Riehl&rsquo;s answer is,
that the <i>Philister</i> &ldquo;is one who is indifferent to all
social interests, all public life, as distinguished from selfish
and private interests; he has no sympathy with political and
social events except as they affect his own comfort and
prosperity, as they offer him material for amusement or
opportunity for gratifying his vanity.&nbsp; He has no social or
political creed, but is always of the opinion which is most
convenient for the moment.&nbsp; He is always in the majority,
and is the main element of unreason and stupidity in the judgment
of a &ldquo;discerning public.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems presumptuous
in us to dispute Riehl&rsquo;s interpretation of a German word,
but we must think that, in literature, the epithet
<i>Philister</i> has usually a wider meaning than
this&mdash;includes his definition and something more.&nbsp; We
imagine the <i>Philister</i> is the personification of the spirit
which judges everything from a lower point of view than the
subject demands; which judges the affairs of the parish from the
egotistic or purely personal point of view; which judges the
affairs of the nation from the parochial point of view, and does
not hesitate to measure the merits of the universe from the human
point of view.&nbsp; At least this must surely be the spirit to
which Goethe alludes in a passage cited by Riehl himself, where
he says that the Germans need not be ashamed of erecting a
monument to him as well as to Blucher; for if Blucher had freed
them from the French, he (Goethe) had freed them from the nets of
the <i>Philister</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ihr m&ouml;gt mirimmer ungescheut<br />
Gleich Bl&uuml;chern Denkmal setzen!<br />
Von Franzosen hat er euch befreit,<br />
Ich von Philister-netzen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goethe could hardly claim to be the apostle of public spirit;
but he is eminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point
of observation, so that we may see things in their relative
proportions.</p>
<p>The most interesting chapters in the description of the <!--
page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;Fourth Estate,&rdquo; which concludes the
volume, are those on the &ldquo;Aristocratic Proletariat&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Intellectual Proletariat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Fourth
Estate in Germany, says Riehl, has its centre of gravity not, as
in England and France, in the day laborers and factory
operatives, and still less in the degenerate peasantry.&nbsp; In
Germany the <i>educated</i> proletariat is the leaven that sets
the mass in fermentation; the dangerous classes there go about,
not in blouses, but in frock coats; they begin with the
impoverished prince and end in the hungriest
<i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>.&nbsp; The custom that all the sons of
a nobleman shall inherit their father&rsquo;s title necessarily
goes on multiplying that class of aristocrats who are not only
without function but without adequate provision, and who shrink
from entering the ranks of the citizens by adopting some honest
calling.&nbsp; The younger son of a prince, says Riehl, is
usually obliged to remain without any vocation; and however
zealously he may study music, painting, literature, or science,
he can never be a regular musician, painter, or man of science;
his pursuit will be called a &ldquo;passion,&rdquo; not a
&ldquo;calling,&rdquo; and to the end of his days he remains a
dilettante.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the ardent pursuit of a fixed
practical calling can alone satisfy the active man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Direct legislation cannot remedy this evil.&nbsp; The inheritance
of titles by younger sons is the universal custom, and custom is
stronger than law.&nbsp; But if all government preference for the
&ldquo;aristocratic proletariat&rdquo; were withdrawn, the
sensible men among them would prefer emigration, or the pursuit
of some profession, to the hungry distinction of a title without
rents.</p>
<p>The intellectual proletaires Riehl calls the &ldquo;church
militant&rdquo; of the Fourth Estate in Germany.&nbsp; In no
other country are they so numerous; in no other country is the
trade in material and industrial capital so far exceeded by the
wholesale and retail trade, the traffic and the usury, in the
intellectual capital of the nation.&nbsp; <i>Germany yields more
intellectual produce than it can use and pay for</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This over-production, which is not
transient but permanent, nay, is constantly on the increase,
evidences a diseased state of the national <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>industry, a
perverted application of industrial powers, and is a far more
pungent satire on the national condition than all the poverty of
operatives and peasants. . . . Other nations need not envy us the
preponderance of the intellectual proletariat over the
proletaires of manual labor.&nbsp; For man more easily becomes
diseased from over-study than from the labor of the hands; and it
is precisely in the intellectual proletariat that there are the
most dangerous seeds of disease.&nbsp; This is the group in which
the opposition between earnings and wants, between the ideal
social position and the real, is the most hopelessly
irreconcilable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must unwillingly leave our readers to make acquaintance for
themselves with the graphic details with which Riehl follows up
this general statement; but before quitting these admirable
volumes, let us say, lest our inevitable omissions should have
left room for a different conclusion, that Riehl&rsquo;s
conservatism is not in the least tinged with the partisanship of
a class, with a poetic fanaticism for the past, or with the
prejudice of a mind incapable of discerning the grander evolution
of things to which all social forms are but temporarily
subservient.&nbsp; It is the conservatism of a clear-eyed,
practical, but withal large-minded man&mdash;a little caustic,
perhaps, now and then in his epigrams on democratic doctrinaires
who have their nostrum for all political and social diseases, and
on communistic theories which he regards as &ldquo;the despair of
the individual in his own manhood, reduced to a system,&rdquo;
but nevertheless able and willing to do justice to the elements
of fact and reason in every shade of opinion and every form of
effort.&nbsp; He is as far as possible from the folly of
supposing that the sun will go backward on the dial because we
put the hands of our clock backward; he only contends against the
opposite folly of decreeing that it shall be mid-day while in
fact the sun is only just touching the mountain-tops, and all
along the valley men are stumbling in the twilight.</p>
<h3><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>VI.&nbsp; SILLY NOVELS BY LADY
NOVELISTS.</h3>
<p>Silly Novels by Lady Novelists are a genus with many species,
determined by the particular quality of silliness that
predominates in them&mdash;the frothy, the prosy, the pious, or
the pedantic.&nbsp; But it is a mixture of all these&mdash;a
composite order of feminine fatuity&mdash;that produces the
largest class of such novels, which we shall distinguish as the
<i>mind-and-millinery</i> species.&nbsp; The heroine is usually
an heiress, probably a peeress in her own right, with perhaps a
vicious baronet, an amiable duke, and an irresistible younger son
of a marquis as lovers in the foreground, a clergyman and a poet
sighing for her in the middle distance, and a crowd of undefined
adorers dimly indicated beyond.&nbsp; Her eyes and her wit are
both dazzling; her nose and her morals are alike free from any
tendency to irregularity; she has a superb <i>contralto</i> and a
superb intellect; she is perfectly well dressed and perfectly
religious; she dances like a sylph, and reads the Bible in the
original tongues.&nbsp; Or it may be that the heroine is not an
heiress&mdash;that rank and wealth are the only things in which
she is deficient; but she infallibly gets into high society, she
has the triumph of refusing many matches and securing the best,
and she wears some family jewels or other as a sort of crown of
righteousness at the end.&nbsp; Rakish men either bite their lips
in impotent confusion at her repartees, or are touched to
penitence by her reproofs, which, on appropriate occasions, rise
to a lofty strain of rhetoric; indeed, there is a general
propensity in her to make speeches, and to rhapsodize at some
length when she retires to her bedroom.&nbsp; In her recorded
conversations she is amazingly <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>eloquent,
and in her unrecorded conversations amazingly witty.&nbsp; She is
understood to have a depth of insight that looks through and
through the shallow theories of philosophers, and her superior
instincts are a sort of dial by which men have only to set their
clocks and watches, and all will go well.&nbsp; The men play a
very subordinate part by her side.&nbsp; You are consoled now and
then by a hint that they have affairs, which keeps you in mind
that the working-day business of the world is somehow being
carried on, but ostensibly the final cause of their existence is
that they may accompany the heroine on her &ldquo;starring&rdquo;
expedition through life.&nbsp; They see her at a ball, and they
are dazzled; at a flower-show, and they are fascinated; on a
riding excursion, and they are witched by her noble horsemanship;
at church, and they are awed by the sweet solemnity of her
demeanor.&nbsp; She is the ideal woman in feelings, faculties,
and flounces.&nbsp; For all this she as often as not marries the
wrong person to begin with, and she suffers terribly from the
plots and intrigues of the vicious baronet; but even death has a
soft place in his heart for such a paragon, and remedies all
mistakes for her just at the right moment.&nbsp; The vicious
baronet is sure to be killed in a duel, and the tedious husband
dies in his bed requesting his wife, as a particular favor to
him, to marry the man she loves best, and having already
dispatched a note to the lover informing him of the comfortable
arrangement.&nbsp; Before matters arrive at this desirable issue
our feelings are tried by seeing the noble, lovely, and gifted
heroine pass through many <i>mauvais moments</i>, but we have the
satisfaction of knowing that her sorrows are wept into
embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, that her fainting form reclines
on the very best upholstery, and that whatever vicissitudes she
may undergo, from being dashed out of her carriage to having her
head shaved in a fever, she comes out of them all with a
complexion more blooming and locks more redundant than ever.</p>
<p>We may remark, by the way, that we have been relieved from a
serious scruple by discovering that silly novels by lady <!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>novelists rarely introduce us into any other than very
lofty and fashionable society.&nbsp; We had imagined that
destitute women turned novelists, as they turned governesses,
because they had no other &ldquo;ladylike&rdquo; means of getting
their bread.&nbsp; On this supposition, vacillating syntax, and
improbable incident had a certain pathos for us, like the
extremely supererogatory pincushions and ill-devised nightcaps
that are offered for sale by a blind man.&nbsp; We felt the
commodity to be a nuisance, but we were glad to think that the
money went to relieve the necessitous, and we pictured to
ourselves lonely women struggling for a maintenance, or wives and
daughters devoting themselves to the production of
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; out of pure heroism&mdash;perhaps to pay their
husband&rsquo;s debts or to purchase luxuries for a sick
father.&nbsp; Under these impressions we shrank from criticising
a lady&rsquo;s novel: her English might be faulty, but we said to
ourselves her motives are irreproachable; her imagination may be
uninventive, but her patience is untiring.&nbsp; Empty writing
was excused by an empty stomach, and twaddle was consecrated by
tears.&nbsp; But no!&nbsp; This theory of ours, like many other
pretty theories, has had to give way before observation.&nbsp;
Women&rsquo;s silly novels, we are now convinced, are written
under totally different circumstances.&nbsp; The fair writers
have evidently never talked to a tradesman except from a carriage
window; they have no notion of the working-classes except as
&ldquo;dependents;&rdquo; they think five hundred a year a
miserable pittance; Belgravia and &ldquo;baronial halls&rdquo;
are their primary truths; and they have no idea of feeling
interest in any man who is not at least a great landed
proprietor, if not a prime minister.&nbsp; It is clear that they
write in elegant boudoirs, with violet-colored ink and a ruby
pen; that they must be entirely indifferent to publishers&rsquo;
accounts, and inexperienced in every form of poverty except
poverty of brains.&nbsp; It is true that we are constantly struck
with the want of verisimilitude in their representations of the
high society in which they seem to live; but then they betray no
closer acquaintance with any other form of life.&nbsp; If their
peers and peeresses are improbable, their <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>literary
men, tradespeople, and cottagers are impossible; and their
intellect seems to have the peculiar impartiality of reproducing
both what they <i>have</i> seen and heard, and what they have
<i>not</i> seen and heard, with equal unfaithfulness.</p>
<p>There are few women, we suppose, who have not seen something
of children under five years of age, yet in
&ldquo;Compensation,&rdquo; a recent novel of the
mind-and-millinery species, which calls itself a &ldquo;story of
real life,&rdquo; we have a child of four and a half years old
talking in this Ossianic fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I am so happy, dear grand
mamma;&mdash;I have seen&mdash;I have seen such a delightful
person; he is like everything beautiful&mdash;like the smell of
sweet flowers, and the view from Ben Lemond;&mdash;or no,
<i>better than that</i>&mdash;he is like what I think of and see
when I am very, very happy; and he is really like mamma, too,
when she sings; and his forehead is like <i>that distant
sea</i>,&rsquo; she continued, pointing to the blue
Mediterranean; &lsquo;there seems no end&mdash;no end; or like
the clusters of stars I like best to look at on a warm fine
night. . . . Don&rsquo;t look so . . . your forehead is like Loch
Lomond, when the wind is blowing and the sun is gone in; I like
the sunshine best when the lake is smooth. . . . So now&mdash;I
like it better than ever . . . It is more beautiful still from
the dark cloud that has gone over it, <i>when the sun suddenly
lights up all the colors of the forests and shining purple
rocks</i>, <i>and it is all reflected in the waters
below</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not surprised to learn that the mother of this infant
phenomenon, who exhibits symptoms so alarmingly like those of
adolescence repressed by gin, is herself a ph&oelig;nix.&nbsp; We
are assured, again and again, that she had a remarkably original
in mind, that she was a genius, and &ldquo;conscious of her
originality,&rdquo; and she was fortunate enough to have a lover
who was also a genius and a man of &ldquo;most original
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lover, we read, though &ldquo;wonderfully similar&rdquo;
to her &ldquo;in powers and capacity,&rdquo; was
&ldquo;infinitely superior to her in faith and
development,&rdquo; and she saw in him
&ldquo;&lsquo;Agape&rsquo;&mdash;so rare to find&mdash;of which
she had read and admired the meaning in her Greek Testament;
having, <i>from her great facility in learning languages</i>,
read the Scriptures in their original
<i>tongues</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; Greek and Hebrew
are mere play to <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>a heroine; Sanscrit is no more than
<i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> to her; and she can talk with perfect
correctness in any language, except English.&nbsp; She is a
polking polyglot, a Creuzer in crinoline.&nbsp; Poor men.&nbsp;
There are so few of you who know even Hebrew; you think it
something to boast of if, like Bolingbroke, you only
&ldquo;understand that sort of learning and what is writ about
it;&rdquo; and you are perhaps adoring women who can think
slightingly of you in all the Semitic languages
successively.&nbsp; But, then, as we are almost invariably told
that a heroine has a &ldquo;beautifully small head,&rdquo; and as
her intellect has probably been early invigorated by an attention
to costume and deportment, we may conclude that she can pick up
the Oriental tongues, to say nothing of their dialects, with the
same a&euml;rial facility that the butterfly sips nectar.&nbsp;
Besides, there can be no difficulty in conceiving the depth of
the heroine&rsquo;s erudition when that of the authoress is so
evident.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Laura Gay,&rdquo; another novel of the same school,
the heroine seems less at home in Greek and Hebrew but she makes
up for the deficiency by a quite playful familiarity with the
Latin classics&mdash;with the &ldquo;dear old Virgil,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the graceful Horace, the humane Cicero, and the pleasant
Livy;&rdquo; indeed, it is such a matter of course with her to
quote Latin that she does it at a picnic in a very mixed company
of ladies and gentlemen, having, we are told, &ldquo;no
conception that the nobler sex were capable of jealousy on this
subject.&nbsp; And if, indeed,&rdquo; continues the biographer of
Laura Gray, &ldquo;the wisest and noblest portion of that sex
were in the majority, no such sentiment would exist; but while
Miss Wyndhams and Mr. Redfords abound, great sacrifices must be
made to their existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such sacrifices, we
presume, as abstaining from Latin quotations, of extremely
moderate interest and applicability, which the wise and noble
minority of the other sex would be quite as willing to dispense
with as the foolish and ignoble majority.&nbsp; It is as little
the custom of well-bred men as of well-bred women to quote Latin
in mixed parties; they can contain their familiarity with
&ldquo;the humane Cicero&rdquo; without allowing it <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>to
boil over in ordinary conversation, and even references to
&ldquo;the pleasant Livy&rdquo; are not absolutely
irrepressible.&nbsp; But Ciceronian Latin is the mildest form of
Miss Gay&rsquo;s conversational power.&nbsp; Being on the
Palatine with a party of sight-seers, she falls into the
following vein of well-rounded remark: &ldquo;Truth can only be
pure objectively, for even in the creeds where it predominates,
being subjective, and parcelled out into portions, each of these
necessarily receives a hue of idiosyncrasy, that is, a taint of
superstition more or less strong; while in such creeds as the
Roman Catholic, ignorance, interest, the basis of ancient
idolatries, and the force of authority, have gradually
accumulated on the pure truth, and transformed it, at last, into
a mass of superstition for the majority of its votaries; and how
few are there, alas! whose zeal, courage, and intellectual energy
are equal to the analysis of this accumulation, and to the
discovery of the pearl of great price which lies hidden beneath
this heap of rubbish.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have often met with women
much more novel and profound in their observations than Laura
Gay, but rarely with any so inopportunely long-winded.&nbsp; A
clerical lord, who is half in love with her, is alarmed by the
daring remarks just quoted, and begins to suspect that she is
inclined to free-thinking.&nbsp; But he is mistaken; when in a
moment of sorrow he delicately begs leave to &ldquo;recall to her
memory, a <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> of strength and consolation under
affliction, which, until we are hard pressed by the trials of
life, we are too apt to forget,&rdquo; we learn that she really
has &ldquo;recurrence to that sacred dep&ocirc;t,&rdquo; together
with the tea-pot.&nbsp; There is a certain flavor of orthodoxy
mixed with the parade of fortunes and fine carriages in
&ldquo;Laura Gay,&rdquo; but it is an orthodoxy mitigated by
study of &ldquo;the humane Cicero,&rdquo; and by an
&ldquo;intellectual disposition to analyze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compensation&rdquo; is much more heavily dosed with
doctrine, but then it has a treble amount of snobbish worldliness
and absurd incident to tickle the palate of pious
frivolity.&nbsp; Linda, the heroine, is still more speculative
and spiritual than Laura Gay, but she has been
&ldquo;presented,&rdquo; and has more and far <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>grander
lovers; very wicked and fascinating women are
introduced&mdash;even a French <i>lionne</i>; and no expense is
spared to get up as exciting a story as you will find in the most
immoral novels.&nbsp; In fact, it is a wonderful <i>pot
pourri</i> of Almack&rsquo;s, Scotch second-sight, Mr.
Rogers&rsquo;s breakfasts, Italian brigands, death-bed
conversions, superior authoresses, Italian mistresses, and
attempts at poisoning old ladies, the whole served up with a
garnish of talk about &ldquo;faith and development&rdquo; and
&ldquo;most original minds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Miss Susan Barton,
the superior authoress, whose pen moves in a &ldquo;quick,
decided manner when she is composing,&rdquo; declines the finest
opportunities of marriage; and though old enough to be
Linda&rsquo;s mother (since we are told that she refused
Linda&rsquo;s father), has her hand sought by a young earl, the
heroine&rsquo;s rejected lover.&nbsp; Of course, genius and
morality must be backed by eligible offers, or they would seem
rather a dull affair; and piety, like other things, in order to
be <i>comme il faut</i>, must be in &ldquo;society,&rdquo; and
have admittance to the best circles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rank and Beauty&rdquo; is a more frothy and less
religious variety of the mind-and-millinery species.&nbsp; The
heroine, we are told, &ldquo;if she inherited her father&rsquo;s
pride of birth and her mother&rsquo;s beauty of person, had in
herself a tone of enthusiastic feeling that, perhaps, belongs to
her age even in the lowly born, but which is refined into the
high spirit of wild romance only in the far descended, who feel
that it is their best inheritance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This enthusiastic
young lady, by dint of reading the newspaper to her father, falls
in love with the <i>prime minister</i>, who, through the medium
of leading articles and &ldquo;the <i>resum&eacute;</i> of the
debates,&rdquo; shines upon her imagination as a bright
particular star, which has no parallax for her living in the
country as simple Miss Wyndham.&nbsp; But she forthwith becomes
Baroness Umfraville in her own right, astonishes the world with
her beauty and accomplishments when she bursts upon it from her
mansion in Spring Gardens, and, as you foresee, will presently
come into contact with the unseen <i>objet aim&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
Perhaps the words &ldquo;prime minister&rdquo; suggest to you a
wrinkled or <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>obese sexagenarian; but pray dismiss
the image.&nbsp; Lord Rupert Conway has been &ldquo;called while
still almost a youth to the first situation which a subject can
hold in the <i>universe</i>,&rdquo; and even leading articles and
a <i>resum&eacute;</i> of the debates have not conjured up a
dream that surpasses the fact.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The door opened again, and Lord Rupert
Conway entered.&nbsp; Evelyn gave one glance.&nbsp; It was
enough; she was not disappointed.&nbsp; It seemed as if a picture
on which she had long gazed was suddenly instinct with life, and
had stepped from its frame before her.&nbsp; His tall figure, the
distinguished simplicity of his air&mdash;it was a living
Vandyke, a cavalier, one of his noble cavalier ancestors, or one
to whom her fancy had always likened him, who long of yore had
with an Umfraville fought the Paynim far beyond the sea.&nbsp;
Was this reality?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very little like it, certainly.</p>
<p>By and by it becomes evident that the ministerial heart is
touched.&nbsp; Lady Umfraville is on a visit to the Queen at
Windsor, and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The last evening of her stay, when they
returned from riding, Mr. Wyndham took her and a large party to
the top of the Keep, to see the view.&nbsp; She was leaning on
the battlements, gazing from that &lsquo;stately height&rsquo; at
the prospect beneath her, when Lord Rupert was by her side.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What an unrivalled view!&rsquo; exclaimed she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it would have been wrong to go without
having been up here.&nbsp; You are pleased with your
visit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Enchanted!&nbsp; A Queen to live and die under,
to live and die for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; cried he, with sudden emotion, and
with a <i>eureka</i> expression of countenance, as if he had
<i>indeed found a heart in unison with his own</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;<i>eureka</i> expression of countenance&rdquo; you
see at once to be prophetic of marriage at the end of the third
volume; but before that desirable consummation there are very
complicated misunderstandings, arising chiefly from the
vindictive plotting of Sir Luttrel Wycherley, who is a genius, a
poet, and in every way a most remarkable character indeed.&nbsp;
He is not only a romantic poet, but a hardened rake and a cynical
wit; yet <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>his deep passion for Lady Umfraville
has so impoverished his epigrammatic talent that he cuts an
extremely poor figure in conversation.&nbsp; When she rejects
him, he rushes into the shrubbery and rolls himself in the dirt;
and on recovering, devotes himself to the most diabolical and
laborious schemes of vengeance, in the course of which he
disguises himself as a quack physician and enters into general
practice, foreseeing that Evelyn will fall ill, and that he shall
be called in to attend her.&nbsp; At last, when all his schemes
are frustrated, he takes leave of her in a long letter, written,
as you will perceive from the following passage, entirely in the
style of an eminent literary man:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure, will
you ever cast one thought upon the miserable being who addresses
you?&nbsp; Will you ever, as your gilded galley is floating down
the unruffled stream of prosperity, will you ever, while lulled
by the sweetest music&mdash;thine own praises&mdash;hear the
far-off sigh from that world to which I am going?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, however, frothy as it is, we rather prefer
&ldquo;Rank and Beauty&rdquo; to the two other novels we have
mentioned.&nbsp; The dialogue is more natural and spirited; there
is some frank ignorance and no pedantry; and you are allowed to
take the heroine&rsquo;s astounding intellect upon trust, without
being called on to read her conversational refutations of
sceptics and philosophers, or her rhetorical solutions of the
mysteries of the universe.</p>
<p>Writers of the mind-and-millinery school are remarkably
unanimous in their choice of diction.&nbsp; In their novels there
is usually a lady or gentleman who is more or less of a upas
tree; the lover has a manly breast; minds are redolent of various
things; hearts are hollow; events are utilized; friends are
consigned to the tomb; infancy is an engaging period; the sun is
a luminary that goes to his western couch, or gathers the
rain-drops into his refulgent bosom; life is a melancholy boon;
Albion and Scotia are conversational epithets.&nbsp; There is a
striking resemblance, too, in the character of their moral
comments, such, for instance, as that &ldquo;It is a fact, no
less true <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>than melancholy, that all people,
more or less, richer or poorer, are swayed by bad example;&rdquo;
that &ldquo;Books, however trivial, contain some subjects from
which useful information may be drawn;&rdquo; that &ldquo;Vice
can too often borrow the language of virtue;&rdquo; that
&ldquo;Merit and nobility of nature must exist, to be accepted,
for clamor and pretension cannot impose upon those too well read
in human nature to be easily deceived;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;In
order to forgive, we must have been injured.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is doubtless a class of readers to whom these remarks appear
peculiarly pointed and pungent; for we often find them doubly and
trebly scored with the pencil, and delicate hands giving in their
determined adhesion to these hardy novelties by a distinct
<i>tr&egrave;s vrai</i>, emphasized by many notes of
exclamation.&nbsp; The colloquial style of these novels is often
marked by much ingenious inversion, and a careful avoidance of
such cheap phraseology as can be heard every day.&nbsp; Angry
young gentlemen exclaim, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis ever thus,
methinks;&rdquo; and in the half hour before dinner a young lady
informs her next neighbor that the first day she read Shakespeare
she &ldquo;stole away into the park, and beneath the shadow of
the greenwood tree, devoured with rapture the inspired page of
the great magician.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the most remarkable efforts
of the mind-and-millinery writers lie in their philosophic
reflections.&nbsp; The authoress of &ldquo;Laura Gay,&rdquo; for
example, having married her hero and heroine, improves the event
by observing that &ldquo;if those sceptics, whose eyes have so
long gazed on matter that they can no longer see aught else in
man, could once enter with heart and soul, into such bliss as
this, they would come to say that the soul of man and the polypus
are not of common origin, or of the same texture.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lady novelists, it appears, can see something else besides
matter; they are not limited to phenomena, but can relieve their
eyesight by occasional glimpses of the <i>noumenon</i>, and are,
therefore, naturally better able than any one else to confound
sceptics, even of that remarkable but to us unknown school which
maintains that the soul of man is of the same texture as the
polypus.</p>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>The most pitiable of all silly novels by lady novelists
are what we may call the <i>oracular</i> species&mdash;novels
intended to expound the writer&rsquo;s religious, philosophical,
or moral theories.&nbsp; There seems to be a notion abroad among
women, rather akin to the superstition that the speech and
actions of idiots are inspired, and that the human being most
entirely exhausted of common-sense is the fittest vehicle of
revelation.&nbsp; To judge from their writings, there are certain
ladies who think that an amazing ignorance, both of science and
of life, is the best possible qualification for forming an
opinion on the knottiest moral and speculative questions.&nbsp;
Apparently, their recipe for solving all such difficulties is
something like this: Take a woman&rsquo;s head, stuff it with a
smattering of philosophy and literature chopped small, and with
false notions of society baked hard, let it hang over a desk a
few hours every day, and serve up hot in feeble English when not
required.&nbsp; You will rarely meet with a lady novelist of the
oracular class who is diffident of her ability to decide on
theological questions&mdash;who has any suspicion that she is not
capable of discriminating with the nicest accuracy between the
good and evil in all church parties&mdash;who does not see
precisely how it is that men have gone wrong hitherto&mdash;and
pity philosophers in general that they have not had the
opportunity of consulting her.&nbsp; Great writers, who have
modestly contented themselves with putting their experience into
fiction, and have thought it quite a sufficient task to exhibit
men and things as they are, she sighs over as deplorably
deficient in the application of their powers.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
have solved no great questions&rdquo;&mdash;and she is ready to
remedy their omission by setting before you a complete theory of
life and manual of divinity in a love story, where ladies and
gentlemen of good family go through genteel vicissitudes, to the
utter confusion of Deists, Puseyites, and ultra-Protestants, and
to the perfect establishment of that peculiar view of
Christianity which either condenses itself into a sentence of
small caps, or explodes into a cluster of stars on the three
hundred and thirtieth page.&nbsp; It is true, the ladies and <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>gentlemen will probably seem to you remarkably little
like any you have had the fortune or misfortune to meet with,
for, as a general rule, the ability of a lady novelist to
describe actual life and her fellow-men is in inverse proportion
to her confident eloquence about God and the other world, and the
means by which she usually chooses to conduct you to true ideas
of the invisible is a totally false picture of the visible.</p>
<p>As typical a novel of the oracular kind as we can hope to meet
with, is &ldquo;The Enigma: a Leaf from the Chronicles of the
Wolchorley House.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;enigma&rdquo; which
this novel is to solve is certainly one that demands powers no
less gigantic than those of a lady novelist, being neither more
nor less than the existence of evil.&nbsp; The problem is stated
and the answer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page.&nbsp;
The spirited young lady, with raven hair, says, &ldquo;All life
is an inextricable confusion;&rdquo; and the meek young lady,
with auburn hair, looks at the picture of the Madonna which she
is copying, and&mdash;&ldquo;<i>There</i> seemed the solution of
that mighty enigma.&rdquo;&nbsp; The style of this novel is quite
as lofty as its purpose; indeed, some passages on which we have
spent much patient study are quite beyond our reach, in spite of
the illustrative aid of italics and small caps; and we must await
further &ldquo;development&rdquo; in order to understand
them.&nbsp; Of Ernest, the model young clergyman, who sets every
one right on all occasions, we read that &ldquo;he held not of
marriage in the marketable kind, after a social
desecration;&rdquo; that, on one eventful night, &ldquo;sleep had
not visited his divided heart, where tumultuated, in varied type
and combination, the aggregate feelings of grief and joy;&rdquo;
and that, &ldquo;for the <i>marketable</i> human article he had
no toleration, be it of what sort, or set for what value it
might, whether for worship or class, his upright soul abhorred
it, whose ultimatum, the self-deceiver, was to him <span
class="smcap">the</span> <i>great spiritual lie</i>,
&lsquo;living in a vain show, deceiving and being
deceived;&rsquo; since he did not suppose the phylactery and
enlarged border on the garment to be <i>merely</i> a social
trick.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The italics and small caps are the
author&rsquo;s, and we hope they assist the reader&rsquo;s <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>comprehension.)&nbsp; Of Sir Lionel, the model old
gentleman, we are told that &ldquo;the simple ideal of the middle
age, apart from its anarchy and decadence, in him most truly
seemed to live again, when the ties which knit men together were
of heroic cast.&nbsp; The first-born colors of pristine faith and
truth engraven on the common soul of man, and blent into the wide
arch of brotherhood, where the prim&aelig;val law of <i>order</i>
grew and multiplied each perfect after his kind, and mutually
interdependent.&rdquo;&nbsp; You see clearly, of course, how
colors are first engraven on the soul, and then blent into a wide
arch, on which arch of colors&mdash;apparently a
rainbow&mdash;the law of order grew and multiplied,
each&mdash;apparently the arch and the law&mdash;perfect after
his kind?&nbsp; If, after this, you can possibly want any further
aid toward knowing what Sir Lionel was, we can tell you that in
his soul &ldquo;the scientific combinations of thought could
educe no fuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in
the prim&aelig;val pulses which floated as an atmosphere around
it!&rdquo; and that, when he was sealing a letter, &ldquo;Lo! the
responsive throb in that good man&rsquo;s bosom echoed back in
simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him
not, as his eye, bedewed with love, rested, too, with something
of ancestral pride, on the undimmed motto of the
family&mdash;&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Loiaute</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slightest matters have their vulgarity fumigated out of
them by the same elevated style.&nbsp; Commonplace people would
say that a copy of Shakespeare lay on a drawing-room table; but
the authoress of &ldquo;The Enigma,&rdquo; bent on edifying
periphrasis, tells you that there lay on the table, &ldquo;that
fund of human thought and feeling, which teaches the heart
through the little name, &lsquo;Shakespeare.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
A watchman sees a light burning in an upper window rather longer
than usual, and thinks that people are foolish to sit up late
when they have an opportunity of going to bed; but, lest this
fact should seem too low and common, it is presented to us in the
following striking and metaphysical manner: &ldquo;He
marvelled&mdash;as a man <i>will</i> think for others in a
necessarily separate personality, <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>consequently (though disallowing it) in false mental
premise&mdash;how differently <i>he</i> should act, how gladly
<i>he</i> should prize the rest so lightly held of
within.&rdquo;&nbsp; A footman&mdash;an ordinary Jeames, with
large calves and aspirated vowels&mdash;answers the door-bell,
and the opportunity is seized to tell you that he was a
&ldquo;type of the large class of pampered menials, who follow
the curse of Cain&mdash;&lsquo;vagabonds&rsquo; on the face of
the earth, and whose estimate of the human class varies in the
graduated scale of money and expenditure. . . . These, and such
as these, O England, be the false lights of thy morbid
civilization!&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard of various &ldquo;false
lights,&rdquo; from Dr. Cumming to Robert Owen, from Dr. Pusey to
the Spirit-rappers, but we never before heard of the false light
that emanates from plush and powder.</p>
<p>In the same way very ordinary events of civilized life are
exalted into the most awful crises, and ladies in full skirts and
<i>manches &agrave; la Chinoise</i>, conduct themselves not
unlike the heroines of sanguinary melodramas.&nbsp; Mrs. Percy, a
shallow woman of the world, wishes her son Horace to marry the
auburn-haired Grace, she being an heiress; but he, after the
manner of sons, falls in love with the raven-haired Kate, the
heiress&rsquo;s portionless cousin; and, moreover, Grace herself
shows every symptom of perfect indifference to Horace.&nbsp; In
such cases sons are often sulky or fiery, mothers are alternately
man&oelig;uvring and waspish, and the portionless young lady
often lies awake at night and cries a good deal.&nbsp; We are
getting used to these things now, just as we are used to eclipses
of the moon, which no longer set us howling and beating tin
kettles.&nbsp; We never heard of a lady in a fashionable
&ldquo;front&rdquo; behaving like Mrs. Percy under these
circumstances.&nbsp; Happening one day to see Horace talking to
Grace at a window, without in the least knowing what they are
talking about, or having the least reason to believe that Grace,
who is mistress of the house and a person of dignity, would
accept her son if he were to offer himself, she suddenly rushes
up to them and clasps them both, saying, &ldquo;with a flushed
countenance and in <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>an excited
manner&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This is indeed happiness; for, may I
not call you so, Grace?&mdash;my Grace&mdash;my Horace&rsquo;s
Grace!&mdash;my dear children!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her son tells her she
is mistaken, and that he is engaged to Kate, whereupon we have
the following scene and tableau:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gathering herself up to an unprecedented
height (!) her eyes lightening forth the fire of her anger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wretched boy!&rsquo; she said, hoarsely and
scornfully, and clenching her hand, &lsquo;Take then the doom of
your own choice!&nbsp; Bow down your miserable head and let a
mother&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Curse not!&rsquo; spake a deep low voice from
behind, and Mrs. Percy started, scared, as though she had seen a
heavenly visitant appear, to break upon her in the midst of her
sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime Horace had fallen on his knees, at her feet,
and hid his, face in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then, is she&mdash;who!&nbsp; Truly his
&lsquo;guardian spirit&rsquo; hath stepped between him and the
fearful words, which, however unmerited, must have hung as a pall
over his future existence;&mdash;a spell which could not be
unbound&mdash;which could not be unsaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of an earthly paleness, but calm with the still,
iron-bound calmness of death&mdash;the only calm one
there&mdash;Katherine stood; and her words smote on the ear in
tones whose appallingly slow and separate intonation rung on the
heart like a chill, isolated tolling of some fatal knell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He would have plighted me his faith, but I did
not accept it; you cannot, therefore&mdash;you <i>dare</i> not
curse him.&nbsp; And here,&rsquo; she continued, raising her hand
to heaven, whither her large dark eyes also rose with a chastened
glow, which, for the first time, <i>suffering</i> had lighted in
those passionate orbs&mdash;&lsquo;here I promise, come weal,
come woe, that Horace Wolchorley and I do never interchange vows
without his mother&rsquo;s sanction&mdash;without his
mother&rsquo;s blessing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, and throughout the story, we see that confusion of
purpose which is so characteristic of silly novels written by
women.&nbsp; It is a story of quite modern drawing-room
society&mdash;<!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>a society in which polkas are played
and Puseyism discussed; yet we have characters, and incidents,
and traits of manner introduced, which are mere shreds from the
most heterogeneous romances.&nbsp; We have a blind Irish harper,
&ldquo;relic of the picturesque bards of yore,&rdquo; startling
us at a Sunday-school festival of tea and cake in an English
village; we have a crazy gypsy, in a scarlet cloak, singing
snatches of romantic song, and revealing a secret on her
death-bed which, with the testimony of a dwarfish miserly
merchant, who salutes strangers with a curse and a devilish
laugh, goes to prove that Ernest, the model young clergyman, is
Kate&rsquo;s brother; and we have an ultra-virtuous Irish Barney,
discovering that a document is forged, by comparing the date of
the paper with the date of the alleged signature, although the
same document has passed through a court of law and occasioned a
fatal decision.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; in which Sir Lionel
lives is the venerable country-seat of an old family, and this,
we suppose, sets the imagination of the authoress flying to
donjons and battlements, where &ldquo;lo! the warder blows his
horn;&rdquo; for, as the inhabitants are in their bedrooms on a
night certainly within the recollection of Pleaceman X. and a
breeze springs up, which we are at first told was faint, and then
that it made the old cedars bow their branches to the greensward,
she falls into this medi&aelig;val vein of description (the
italics are ours): &ldquo;The banner <i>unfurled it</i> at the
sound, and shook its guardian wing above, while the startled owl
<i>flapped her</i> in the ivy; the firmament looking down through
her &lsquo;argus eyes&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ministers of heaven&rsquo;s mute
melodies.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lo! two strokes tolled from out the warder tower, and
&lsquo;Two o&rsquo;clock&rsquo; re-echoed its interpreter
below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such stories as this of &ldquo;The Enigma&rdquo; remind us of
the pictures clever children sometimes draw &ldquo;out of their
own head,&rdquo; where you will see a modern villa on the right,
two knights in helmets fighting in the foreground, and a tiger
grinning in a jungle on the left, the several objects being
brought together <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>because the artist thinks each
pretty, and perhaps still more because he remembers seeing them
in other pictures.</p>
<p>But we like the authoress much better on her medi&aelig;val
stilts than on her oracular ones&mdash;when she talks of the
<i>Ich</i> and of &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; and
&ldquo;objective,&rdquo; and lays down the exact line of
Christian verity, between &ldquo;right-hand excesses and
left-hand declensions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Persons who deviate from this
line are introduced with a patronizing air of charity.&nbsp; Of a
certain Miss Inshquine she informs us, with all the lucidity of
italics and small caps, that &ldquo;<i>function</i>, not
<i>form</i>, <span class="smcap">as</span> <i>the inevitable
outer expression of the spirit in this tabernacle age</i>, weakly
engrossed her.&rdquo;&nbsp; And <i>&agrave; propos</i> of Miss
Mayjar, an evangelical lady who is a little too apt to talk of
her visits to sick women and the state of their souls, we are
told that the model clergyman is &ldquo;not one to disallow,
through the <i>super</i> crust, the undercurrent toward good in
the <i>subject</i>, or the positive benefits, nevertheless, to
the <i>object</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We imagine the double-refined
accent and protrusion of chin which are feebly represented by the
italics in this lady&rsquo;s sentences!&nbsp; We abstain from
quoting any of her oracular doctrinal passages, because they
refer to matters too serious for our pages just now.</p>
<p>The epithet &ldquo;silly&rdquo; may seem impertinent, applied
to a novel which indicates so much reading and intellectual
activity as &ldquo;The Enigma,&rdquo; but we use this epithet
advisedly.&nbsp; If, as the world has long agreed, a very great
amount of instruction will not make a wise man, still less will a
very mediocre amount of instruction make a wise woman.&nbsp; And
the most mischievous form of feminine silliness is the literary
form, because it tends to confirm the popular prejudice against
the more solid education of women.</p>
<p>When men see girls wasting their time in consultations about
bonnets and ball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental
love-confidences, or middle-aged women mismanaging their
children, and solacing themselves with acrid gossip, they can
hardly help saying, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let girls be
better educated; let them have some better objects of
thought&mdash;some <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>more solid occupations.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But after a few hours&rsquo; conversation with an oracular
literary woman, or a few hours&rsquo; reading of her books, they
are likely enough to say, &ldquo;After all, when a woman gets
some knowledge, see what use she makes of it!&nbsp; Her knowledge
remains acquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of
being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger
acquaintance with thought and fact, she has a feverish
consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a sort of mental
pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own
&lsquo;intellectuality;&rsquo; she spoils the taste of
one&rsquo;s muffin by questions of metaphysics; &lsquo;puts
down&rsquo; men at a dinner-table with her superior information;
and seizes the opportunity of a <i>soir&eacute;e</i> to catechise
us on the vital question of the relation between mind and
matter.&nbsp; And then, look at her writings!&nbsp; She mistakes
vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for
originality; she struts on one page, rolls her eyes on another,
grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth.&nbsp; She may
have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great
women; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her
own style and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the
difference between his own English and a Londoner&rsquo;s:
rhodomontade is the native accent of her intellect.&nbsp;
No&mdash;the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a
soil to bear much tillage; it is only fit for the very lightest
crops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that the men who come to such a decision on such
very superficial and imperfect observation may not be among the
wisest in the world; but we have not now to contest their
opinion&mdash;we are only pointing out how it is unconsciously
encouraged by many women who have volunteered themselves as
representatives of the feminine intellect.&nbsp; We do not
believe that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by
associating with a woman of true culture, whose mind had absorbed
her knowledge instead of being absorbed by it.&nbsp; A really
cultured woman, like a really cultured man, is all the simpler
and the less obtrusive for her knowledge; it has made her see
herself <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and her opinions in something like
just proportions; she does not make it a pedestal from which she
flatters herself that she commands a complete view of men and
things, but makes it a point of observation from which to form a
right estimate of herself.&nbsp; She neither spouts poetry nor
quotes Cicero on slight provocation; not because she thinks that
a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of men, but because
that mode of exhibiting her memory and Latinity does not present
itself to her as edifying or graceful.&nbsp; She does not write
books to confound philosophers, perhaps because she is able to
write books that delight them.&nbsp; In conversation she is the
least formidable of women, because she understands you, without
wanting to make you aware that you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> understand
her.&nbsp; She does not give you information, which is the raw
material of culture&mdash;she gives you sympathy, which is its
subtlest essence.</p>
<p>A more numerous class of silly novels than the oracular (which
are generally inspired by some form of High Church or
transcendental Christianity) is what we may call the <i>white
neck-cloth</i> species, which represent the tone of thought and
feeling in the Evangelical party.&nbsp; This species is a kind of
genteel tract on a large scale, intended as a sort of medicinal
sweetmeat for Low Church young ladies; an Evangelical substitute
for the fashionable novel, as the May Meetings are a substitute
for the Opera.&nbsp; Even Quaker children, one would think, can
hardly have been denied the indulgence of a doll; but it must be
a doll dressed in a drab gown and a coal-scuttle-bonnet&mdash;not
a worldly doll, in gauze and spangles.&nbsp; And there are no
young ladies, we imagine&mdash;unless they belong to the Church
of the United Brethren, in which people are married without any
love-making&mdash;who can dispense with love stories.&nbsp; Thus,
for Evangelical young ladies there are Evangelical love stories,
in which the vicissitudes of the tender passion are sanctified by
saving views of Regeneration and the Atonement.&nbsp; These
novels differ from the oracular ones, as a Low Churchwoman often
differs from a High Churchwoman: they are a little less <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>supercilious and a great deal more ignorant, a little
less correct in their syntax and a great deal more vulgar.</p>
<p>The Orlando of Evangelical literature is the young curate,
looked at from the point of view of the middle class, where
cambric bands are understood to have as thrilling an effect on
the hearts of young ladies as epaulettes have in the classes
above and below it.&nbsp; In the ordinary type of these novels
the hero is almost sure to be a young curate, frowned upon,
perhaps by worldly mammas, but carrying captive the hearts of
their daughters, who can &ldquo;never forget <i>that</i>
sermon;&rdquo; tender glances are seized from the pulpit stairs
instead of the opera-box; <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>
are seasoned with quotations from Scripture instead of quotations
from the poets; and questions as to the state of the
heroine&rsquo;s affections are mingled with anxieties as to the
state of her soul.&nbsp; The young curate always has a background
of well-dressed and wealthy if not fashionable society&mdash;for
Evangelical silliness is as snobbish as any other kind of
silliness&mdash;and the Evangelical lady novelist, while she
explains to you the type of the scapegoat on one page, is
ambitious on another to represent the manners and conversations
of aristocratic people.&nbsp; Her pictures of fashionable society
are often curious studies, considered as efforts of the
Evangelical imagination; but in one particular the novels of the
White Neck-cloth School are meritoriously realistic&mdash;their
favorite hero, the Evangelical young curate, is always rather an
insipid personage.</p>
<p>The most recent novel of this species that we happen to have
before us is &ldquo;The Old Grey Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
utterly tame and feeble; there is no one set of objects on which
the writer seems to have a stronger grasp than on any other; and
we should be entirely at a loss to conjecture among what phases
of life her experience has been gained, but for certain
vulgarisms of style which sufficiently indicate that she has had
the advantage, though she has been unable to use it, of mingling
chiefly with men and women whose manners and characters have not
had all their bosses and angles rubbed down by refined
conventionalism.&nbsp; It is less excusable in an Evangelical
novelist than <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>in any other, gratuitously to seek
her subjects among titles and carriages.&nbsp; The real drama of
Evangelicalism&mdash;and it has abundance of fine drama for any
one who has genius enough to discern and reproduce it&mdash;lies
among the middle and lower classes; and are not Evangelical
opinions understood to give an especial interest in the weak
things of the earth, rather than in the mighty?&nbsp; Why, then,
cannot our Evangelical lady novelists show us the operation of
their religious views among people (there really are many such in
the world) who keep no carriage, &ldquo;not so much as a
brass-bound gig,&rdquo; who even manage to eat their dinner
without a silver fork, and in whose mouths the authoress&rsquo;s
questionable English would be strictly consistent?&nbsp; Why can
we not have pictures of religious life among the industrial
classes in England, as interesting as Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s pictures
of religious life among the negroes?&nbsp; Instead of this pious
ladies nauseate us with novels which remind us of what we
sometimes see in a worldly woman recently
&ldquo;converted;&rdquo;&mdash;she is as fond of a fine
dinner-table as before, but she invites clergymen instead of
beaux; she thinks as much of her dress as before, but she adopts
a more sober choice of colors and patterns; her conversation is
as trivial as before, but the triviality is flavored with gospel
instead of gossip.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Old Grey Church&rdquo; we
have the same sort of Evangelical travesty of the fashionable
novel, and of course the vicious, intriguing baronet is not
wanting.&nbsp; It is worth while to give a sample of the style of
conversation attributed to this high-born rake&mdash;a style
that, in its profuse italics and palpable innuendoes, is worthy
of Miss Squeers.&nbsp; In an evening visit to the ruins of the
Colosseum, Eustace, the young clergyman, has been withdrawing the
heroine, Miss Lushington, from the rest of the party, for the
sake of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; The
baronet is jealous, and vents his pique in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There they are, and Miss Lushington, no
doubt, quite safe; for she is under the holy guidance of Pope
Eustace the First, who has, of course, been delivering to her an
edifying homily on the wickedness of the heathens of yore, who,
as tradition tells us, in this very <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>place let
loose the wild <i>beastises</i> on poor St. Paul!&mdash;Oh, no!
by the bye, I believe I am wrong, and betraying my want of
clergy, and that it was not at all St. Paul, nor was it
here.&nbsp; But no matter, it would equally serve as a text to
preach from, and from which to diverge to the degenerate
<i>heathen</i> Christians of the present day, and all their
naughty practices, and so end with an exhortation to &lsquo;come
but from among them, and be separate;&rsquo;&mdash;and I am sure,
Miss Lushington, you have most scrupulously conformed to that
injunction this evening, for we have seen nothing of you since
our arrival.&nbsp; But every one seems agreed it has been a
<i>charming party of pleasure</i>, and I am sure we all feel
<i>much indebted</i> to Mr. Gray for having <i>suggested</i> it;
and as he seems so capital a cicerone, I hope he will think of
something else equally agreeable to <i>all</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This drivelling kind of dialogue, and equally drivelling
narrative, which, like a bad drawing, represents nothing, and
barely indicates what is meant to be represented, runs through
the book; and we have no doubt is considered by the amiable
authoress to constitute an improving novel, which Christian
mothers will do well to put into the hands of their
daughters.&nbsp; But everything is relative; we have met with
American vegetarians whose normal diet was dry meal, and who,
when their appetite wanted stimulating, tickled it with
<i>wet</i> meal; and so, we can imagine that there are
Evangelical circles in which &ldquo;The Old Grey Church&rdquo; is
devoured as a powerful and interesting fiction.</p>
<p>But perhaps the least readable of silly women&rsquo;s novels
are the <i>modern-antique</i> species, which unfold to us the
domestic life of Jannes and Jambres, the private love affairs of
Sennacherib, or the mental struggles and ultimate conversion of
Demetrius the silversmith.&nbsp; From most silly novels we can at
least extract a laugh; but those of the modern-antique school
have a ponderous, a leaden kind of fatuity, under which we
groan.&nbsp; What can be more demonstrative of the inability of
literary women to measure their own powers than their frequent
assumption of a task which can only be justified by the rarest
concurrence of acquirement with genius?&nbsp; The finest effort
to reanimate the past is of course only approximative&mdash;is
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>always more or less an infusion of the modern spirit
into the ancient form&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Was ihr den Geist der Zeiten heisst,<br />
Das ist im Grund der Herren eigner Geist,<br />
In dem die Zeiten sich bespiegeln.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admitting that genius which has familiarized itself with all
the relics of an ancient period can sometimes, by the force of
its sympathetic divination, restore the missing notes in the
&ldquo;music of humanity,&rdquo; and reconstruct the fragments
into a whole which will really bring the remote past nearer to
us, and interpret it to our duller apprehension&mdash;this form
of imaginative power must always be among the very rarest,
because it demands as much accurate and minute knowledge as
creative vigor.&nbsp; Yet we find ladies constantly choosing to
make their mental mediocrity more conspicuous by clothing it in a
masquerade of ancient names; by putting their feeble
sentimentality into the mouths of Roman vestals or Egyptian
princesses, and attributing their rhetorical arguments to Jewish
high-priests and Greek philosophers.&nbsp; A recent example of
this heavy imbecility is &ldquo;Adonijah, a Tale of the Jewish
Dispersion,&rdquo; which forms part of a series,
&ldquo;uniting,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;taste, humor, and
sound principles.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Adonijah,&rdquo; we
presume, exemplifies the tale of &ldquo;sound principles;&rdquo;
the taste and humor are to be found in other members of the
series.&nbsp; We are told on the cover that the incidents of this
tale are &ldquo;fraught with unusual interest,&rdquo; and the
preface winds up thus: &ldquo;To those who feel interested in the
dispersed of Israel and Judea, these pages may afford, perhaps,
information on an important subject, as well as
amusement.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the &ldquo;important subject&rdquo;
on which this book is to afford information is not specified, it
may possibly lie in some esoteric meaning to which we have no
key; but if it has relation to the dispersed of Israel and Judea
at any period of their history, we believe a tolerably
well-informed school-girl already knows much more of it than she
will find in this &ldquo;Tale of the Jewish
Dispersion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Adonijah&rdquo; is simply the
feeblest kind of love story, supposed <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>to be
instructive, we presume, because the hero is a Jewish captive and
the heroine a Roman vestal; because they and their friends are
converted to Christianity after the shortest and easiest method
approved by the &ldquo;Society for Promoting the Conversion of
the Jews;&rdquo; and because, instead of being written in plain
language, it is adorned with that peculiar style of
grandiloquence which is held by some lady novelists to give an
antique coloring, and which we recognize at once in such phrases
as these:&mdash;&ldquo;the splendid regnal talent, undoubtedly,
possessed by the Emperor Nero&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the expiring
scion of a lofty stem&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the virtuous partner of
his couch&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;ah, by Vesta!&rdquo;&mdash;and
&ldquo;I tell thee, Roman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the quotations
which serve at once for instruction and ornament on the cover of
this volume, there is one from Miss Sinclair, which informs us
that &ldquo;Works of imagination are <i>avowedly</i> read by men
of science, wisdom, and piety;&rdquo; from which we suppose the
reader is to gather the cheering inference that Dr. Daubeny, Mr.
Mill, or Mr. Maurice may openly indulge himself with the perusal
of &ldquo;Adonijah,&rdquo; without being obliged to secrete it
among the sofa cushions, or read it by snatches under the
dinner-table.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be not a baker if your head be made of butter,&rdquo;
says a homely proverb, which, being interpreted, may mean, let no
woman rush into print who is not prepared for the
consequences.&nbsp; We are aware that our remarks are in a very
different tone from that of the reviewers who, with perennial
recurrence of precisely similar emotions, only paralleled, we
imagine, in the experience of monthly nurses, tell one lady
novelist after another that they &ldquo;hail&rdquo; her
productions &ldquo;with delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are aware that
the ladies at whom our criticism is pointed are accustomed to be
told, in the choicest phraseology of puffery, that their pictures
of life are brilliant, their characters well drawn, their style
fascinating, and their sentiments lofty.&nbsp; But if they are
inclined to resent our plainness of speech, we ask them to
reflect for a moment on the chary <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>praise, and
often captious blame, which their panegyrists give to writers
whose works are on the way to become classics.&nbsp; No sooner
does a woman show that she has genius or effective talent, than
she receives the tribute of being moderately praised and severely
criticised.&nbsp; By a peculiar thermometric adjustment, when a
woman&rsquo;s talent is at zero, journalistic approbation is at
the boiling pitch; when she attains mediocrity, it is already at
no more than summer heat; and if ever she reaches excellence,
critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point.&nbsp; Harriet
Martineau, Currer Bell, and Mrs. Gaskell have been treated as
cavalierly as if they had been men.&nbsp; And every critic who
forms a high estimate of the share women may ultimately take in
literature, will on principle abstain from any exceptional
indulgence toward the productions of literary women.&nbsp; For it
must be plain to every one who looks impartially and extensively
into feminine literature that its greatest deficiencies are due
hardly more to the want of intellectual power than to the want of
those moral qualities that contribute to literary
excellence&mdash;patient diligence, a sense of the responsibility
involved in publication, and an appreciation of the sacredness of
the writer&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; In the majority of woman&rsquo;s
books you see that kind of facility which springs from the
absence of any high standard; that fertility in imbecile
combination or feeble imitation which a little self-criticism
would check and reduce to barrenness; just as with a total want
of musical ear people will sing out of tune, while a degree more
melodic sensibility would suffice to render them silent.&nbsp;
The foolish vanity of wishing to appear in print, instead of
being counterbalanced by any consciousness of the intellectual or
moral derogation implied in futile authorship, seems to be
encouraged by the extremely false impression that to write <i>at
all</i> is a proof of superiority in a woman.&nbsp; On this
ground we believe that the average intellect of women is unfairly
represented by the mass of feminine literature, and that while
the few women who write well are very far above the ordinary
intellectual level of their sex, the many women who write ill are
very far below it.&nbsp; So <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>that, after
all, the severer critics are fulfilling a chivalrous duty in
depriving the mere fact of feminine authorship of any false
prestige which may give it a delusive attraction, and in
recommending women of mediocre faculties&mdash;as at least a
negative service they can render their sex&mdash;to abstain from
writing.</p>
<p>The standing apology for women who become writers without any
special qualification is that society shuts them out from other
spheres of occupation.&nbsp; Society is a very culpable entity,
and has to answer for the manufacture of many unwholesome
commodities, from bad pickles to bad poetry.&nbsp; But society,
like &ldquo;matter,&rdquo; and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government,
and other lofty abstractions, has its share of excessive blame as
well as excessive praise.&nbsp; Where there is one woman who
writes from necessity, we believe there are three women who write
from vanity; and besides, there is something so antispetic in the
mere healthy fact of working for one&rsquo;s bread, that the most
trashy and rotten kind of feminine literature is not likely to
have been produced under such circumstances.&nbsp; &ldquo;In all
labor there is profit;&rdquo; but ladies&rsquo; silly novels, we
imagine, are less the result of labor than of busy idleness.</p>
<p>Happily, we are not dependent on argument to prove that
Fiction is a department of literature in which women can, after
their kind, fully equal men.&nbsp; A cluster of great names, both
living and dead, rush to our memories in evidence that women can
produce novels not only fine, but among the very
finest&mdash;novels, too, that have a precious speciality, lying
quite apart from masculine aptitudes and experience.&nbsp; No
educational restrictions can shut women out from the materials of
fiction, and there is no species of art which is so free from
rigid requirements.&nbsp; Like crystalline masses, it may take
any form, and yet be beautiful; we have only to pour in the right
elements&mdash;genuine observation, humor, and passion.&nbsp; But
it is precisely this absence of rigid requirement which
constitutes the fatal seduction of novel-writing to incompetent
women.&nbsp; Ladies are not wont to be very grossly deceived as
to their power of playing on the piano; here certain positive
difficulties <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of execution have to be conquered,
and incompetence inevitably breaks down.&nbsp; Every art which
had its absolute <i>technique</i> is, to a certain extent,
guarded from the intrusions of mere left-handed imbecility.&nbsp;
But in novel-writing there are no barriers for incapacity to
stumble against, no external criteria to prevent a writer from
mistaking foolish facility for mastery.&nbsp; And so we have
again and again the old story of La Fontaine&rsquo;s ass, who
pats his nose to the flute, and, finding that he elicits some
sound, exclaims, &ldquo;Moi, aussie, je joue de la
flute&rdquo;&mdash;a fable which we commend, at parting, to the
consideration of any feminine reader who is in danger of adding
to the number of &ldquo;silly novels by lady
novelists.&rdquo;</p>

OTHER-WORLDLINESS: THE POET YOUNG. <a name="citation205"></a><a
href="#footnote205" class="citation">[205]</a></h3>
<p>The study of men, as they have appeared in different ages and
under various social conditions, may be considered as the natural
history of the race.&nbsp; Let us, then, for a moment imagine
ourselves, as students of this natural history,
&ldquo;dredging&rdquo; the first half of the eighteenth century
in search of specimens.&nbsp; About the year 1730 we have hauled
up a remarkable individual of the species <i>divine</i>&mdash;a
surprising name, considering the nature of the animal before us,
but we are used to unsuitable names in natural history.&nbsp; Let
us examine this individual at our leisure.&nbsp; He is on the
verge of fifty, and has recently undergone his metamorphosis into
the clerical form.&nbsp; Rather a paradoxical specimen, if you
observe him narrowly: a sort of cross between a sycophant and a
psalmist; a poet whose imagination is alternately fired by the
&ldquo;Last Day&rdquo; and by a creation of peers, who fluctuates
between rhapsodic applause of King George and rhapsodic applause
of Jehovah.&nbsp; After spending &ldquo;a foolish youth, the
sport of peers and poets,&rdquo; after being a hanger-on of the
profligate Duke of Wharton, after aiming in vain at a
parliamentary career, and angling for pensions and preferment
with fulsome dedications and fustian odes, he is a little
disgusted with his imperfect success, and has determined to
retire from the general mendicancy <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>business to
a particular branch; in other words, he has determined on that
renunciation of the world implied in &ldquo;taking orders,&rdquo;
with the prospect of a good living and an advantageous
matrimonial connection.&nbsp; And no man can be better fitted for
an Established Church.&nbsp; He personifies completely her nice
balance of temporalities and spiritualities.&nbsp; He is equally
impressed with the momentousness of death and of burial fees; he
languishes at once for immortal life and for
&ldquo;livings;&rdquo; he has a fervid attachment to patrons in
general, but on the whole prefers the Almighty.&nbsp; He will
teach, with something more than official conviction, the
nothingness of earthly things; and he will feel something more
than private disgust if his meritorious efforts in directing
men&rsquo;s attention to another world are not rewarded by
substantial preferment in this.&nbsp; His secular man believes in
cambric bands and silk stockings as characteristic attire for
&ldquo;an ornament of religion and virtue;&rdquo; hopes courtiers
will never forget to copy Sir Robert Walpole; and writes begging
letters to the King&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; His spiritual man
recognizes no motives more familiar than Golgotha and &ldquo;the
skies;&rdquo; it walks in graveyards, or it soars among the
stars.&nbsp; His religion exhausts itself in ejaculations and
rebukes, and knows no medium between the ecstatic and the
sententious.&nbsp; If it were not for the prospect of
immortality, he considers, it would be wise and agreeable to be
indecent or to murder one&rsquo;s father; and, heaven apart, it
would be extremely irrational in any man not to be a knave.&nbsp;
Man, he thinks, is a compound of the angel and the brute; the
brute is to be humbled by being reminded of its &ldquo;relation
to the stalls,&rdquo; and frightened into moderation by the
contemplation of death-beds and skulls; the angel is to be
developed by vituperating this world and exalting the next; and
by this double process you get the Christian&mdash;&ldquo;the
highest style of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; With all this, our new-made
divine is an unmistakable poet.&nbsp; To a clay compounded
chiefly of the worldling and the rhetorician, there is added a
real spark of Promethean fire.&nbsp; He will one day clothe his
apostrophes and objurgations, his <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>astronomical religion and his charnel-house morality,
in lasting verse, which will stand, like a Juggernaut made of
gold and jewels, at once magnificent and repulsive: for this
divine is Edward Young, the future author of the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be extremely ill-bred in us to suppose that our
readers are not acquainted with the facts of Young&rsquo;s life;
they are among the things that &ldquo;every one knows;&rdquo; but
we have observed that, with regard to these universally known
matters, the majority of readers like to be treated after the
plan suggested by Monsieur Jourdain.&nbsp; When that
distinguished <i>bourgeois</i> was asked if he knew Latin, he
implied, &ldquo;Oui, mais fa&icirc;tes comme si je ne le savais
pas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuming, then, as a polite writer should, that
our readers know everything about Young, it will be a direct
<i>sequitur</i> from that assumption that we should proceed as if
they knew nothing, and recall the incidents of his biography with
as much particularity as we may without trenching on the space we
shall need for our main purpose&mdash;the reconsideration of his
character as a moral and religious poet.</p>
<p>Judging from Young&rsquo;s works, one might imagine that the
preacher had been organized in him by hereditary transmission
through a long line of clerical forefathers&mdash;that the
diamonds of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; had been slowly
condensed from the charcoal of ancestral sermons.&nbsp; Yet it
was not so.&nbsp; His grandfather, apparently, wrote himself
<i>gentleman</i>, not <i>clerk</i>; and there is no evidence that
preaching had run in the family blood before it took that turn in
the person of the poet&rsquo;s father, who was quadruply
clerical, being at once rector, prebendary, court chaplain, and
dean.&nbsp; Young was born at his father&rsquo;s rectory of Upham
in 1681.&nbsp; We may confidently assume that even the author of
the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; came into the world without a
wig; but, apart from Dr. Doran&rsquo;s authority, we should not
have ventured to state that the excellent rector &ldquo;kissed,
<i>with dignified emotion</i>, his only son and intended
namesake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Doran doubtless knows this, from his
intimate acquaintance with clerical physiology and
psychology.&nbsp; He has ascertained that the paternal emotions
of prebendaries have a sacerdotal <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>quality,
and that the very chyme and chyle of a rector are conscious of
the gown and band.</p>
<p>In due time the boy went to Winchester College, and
subsequently, though not till he was twenty-two, to Oxford,
where, for his father&rsquo;s sake, he was befriended by the
wardens of two colleges, and in 1708, three years after his
father&rsquo;s death, nominated by Archbishop Tenison to a law
fellowship at All Souls.&nbsp; Of Young&rsquo;s life at Oxford in
these years, hardly anything is known.&nbsp; His biographer,
Croft, has nothing to tell us but the vague report that, when
&ldquo;Young found himself independent and his own master at All
Souls, he was not the ornament to religion and morality that he
afterward became,&rdquo; and the perhaps apocryphal anecdote,
that Tindal, the atheist, confessed himself embarrassed by the
originality of Young&rsquo;s arguments.&nbsp; Both the report and
the anecdote, however, are borne out by indirect evidence.&nbsp;
As to the latter, Young has left us sufficient proof that he was
fond of arguing on the theological side, and that he had his own
way of treating old subjects.&nbsp; As to the former, we learn
that Pope, after saying other things which we know to be true of
Young, added, that he passed &ldquo;a foolish youth, the sport of
peers and poets;&rdquo; and, from all the indications we possess
of his career till he was nearly fifty, we are inclined to think
that Pope&rsquo;s statement only errs by defect, and that he
should rather have said, &ldquo;a foolish youth and <i>middle</i>
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not likely that Young was a very hard
student, for he impressed Johnson, who saw him in his old age, as
&ldquo;not a great scholar,&rdquo; and as surprisingly ignorant
of what Johnson thought &ldquo;quite common maxims&rdquo; in
literature; and there is no evidence that he filled either his
leisure or his purse by taking pupils.&nbsp; His career as an
author did not commence till he was nearly thirty, even dating
from the publication of a portion of the &ldquo;Last Day,&rdquo;
in the <i>Tatler</i>; so that he could hardly have been absorbed
in composition.&nbsp; But where the fully developed insect is
parasitic, we believe the larva is usually parasitic also, and we
shall probably not be far wrong in supposing that Young at
Oxford, <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>as elsewhere, spent a good deal of
his time in hanging about possible and actual patrons, and
accommodating himself to the habits with considerable flexibility
of conscience and of tongue; being none the less ready, upon
occasion, to present himself as the champion of theology and to
rhapsodize at convenient moments in the company of the skies or
of skulls.&nbsp; That brilliant profligate, the Duke of Wharton,
to whom Young afterward clung as his chief patron, was at this
time a mere boy; and, though it is probable that their intimacy
had commenced, since the Duke&rsquo;s father and mother were
friends of the old dean, that intimacy ought not to aggravate any
unfavorable inference as to Young&rsquo;s Oxford life.&nbsp; It
is less likely that he fell into any exceptional vice than that
he differed from the men around him chiefly in his episodes of
theological advocacy and rhapsodic solemnity.&nbsp; He probably
sowed his wild oats after the coarse fashion of his times, for he
has left us sufficient evidence that his moral sense was not
delicate; but his companions, who were occupied in sowing their
own oats, perhaps took it as a matter of course that he should be
a rake, and were only struck with the exceptional circumstance
that he was a pious and moralizing rake.</p>
<p>There is some irony in the fact that the two first poetical
productions of Young, published in the same year, were his
&ldquo;Epistles to Lord Lansdowne,&rdquo; celebrating the recent
creation of peers&mdash;Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s creation in
particular; and the &ldquo;Last Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other poets
besides Young found the device for obtaining a Tory majority by
turning twelve insignificant commoners into insignificant lords,
an irresistible stimulus to verse; but no other poet showed so
versatile an enthusiasm&mdash;so nearly equal an ardor for the
honor of the new baron and the honor of the Deity.&nbsp; But the
twofold nature of the sycophant and the psalmist is not more
strikingly shown in the contrasted themes of the two poems than
in the transitions from bombast about monarchs to bombast about
the resurrection, in the &ldquo;Last Day&rdquo; itself.&nbsp; The
dedication of the poem to Queen Anne, Young afterward suppressed,
for he was always <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>ashamed of having flattered a dead
patron.&nbsp; In this dedication, Croft tells us, &ldquo;he gives
her Majesty praise indeed for her victories, but says that the
author is more pleased to see her rise from this lower world,
soaring above the clouds, passing the first and second heavens,
and leaving the fixed stars behind her; nor will he lose her
there, he says, but keep her still in view through the boundless
spaces on the other side of creation, in her journey toward
eternal bliss, till he behold the heaven of heavens open, and
angels receiving and conveying her still onward from the stretch
of his imagination, which tires in her pursuit, and falls back
again to earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The self-criticism which prompted the suppression of the
dedication did not, however, lead him to improve either the rhyme
or the reason of the unfortunate couplet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When other Bourbons reign in other
lands,<br />
And, if men&rsquo;s sins forbid not, other Annes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the &ldquo;Epistle to Lord Lansdowne&rdquo; Young indicates
his taste for the drama; and there is evidence that his tragedy
of &ldquo;Busiris&rdquo; was &ldquo;in the theatre&rdquo; as
early as this very year, 1713, though it was not brought on the
stage till nearly six years later; so that Young was now very
decidedly bent on authorship, for which his degree of B.C.L.,
taken in this year, was doubtless a magical equipment.&nbsp;
Another poem, &ldquo;The Force of Religion; or, Vanquished
Love,&rdquo; founded on the execution of Lady Jane Grey and her
husband, quickly followed, showing fertility in feeble and
tasteless verse; and on the Queen&rsquo;s death, in 1714, Young
lost no time in making a poetical lament for a departed patron a
vehicle for extravagant laudation of the new monarch.&nbsp; No
further literary production of his appeared until 1716, when a
Latin oration, which he delivered on the foundation of the
Codrington Library at All Souls, gave him a new opportunity for
displaying his alacrity in inflated panegyric.</p>
<p>In 1717 it is probable that Young accompanied the Duke of
Wharton to Ireland, though so slender are the materials for his
<!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>biography that the chief basis for this supposition is
a passage in his &ldquo;Conjectures on Original
Composition,&rdquo; written when he was nearly eighty, in which
he intimates that he had once been in that country.&nbsp; But
there are many facts surviving to indicate that for the next
eight or nine years Young was a sort of <i>attach&eacute;</i> of
Wharton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In 1719, according to legal records, the
Duke granted him an annuity, in consideration of his having
relinquished the office of tutor to Lord Burleigh, with a life
annuity of &pound;100 a year, on his Grace&rsquo;s assurances
that he would provide for him in a much more ample manner.&nbsp;
And again, from the same evidence, it appears that in 1721 Young
received from Wharton a bond for &pound;600, in compensation of
expenses incurred in standing for Parliament at the Duke&rsquo;s
desire, and as an earnest of greater services which his Grace had
promised him on his refraining from the spiritual and temporal
advantages of taking orders, with a certainty of two livings in
the gift of his college.&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that lay
advancement, as long as there was any chance of it, had more
attractions for Young than clerical preferment; and that at this
time he accepted the Duke of Wharton as the pilot of his
career.</p>
<p>A more creditable relation of Young&rsquo;s was his friendship
with Tickell, with whom he was in the habit of interchanging
criticisms, and to whom in 1719&mdash;the same year, let us note,
in which he took his doctor&rsquo;s degree&mdash;he addressed his
&ldquo;Lines on the Death of Addison.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close upon
these followed his &ldquo;Paraphrase of part of the Book of
Job,&rdquo; with a dedication to Parker, recently made Lord
Chancellor, showing that the possession of Wharton&rsquo;s
patronage did not prevent Young from fishing in other
waters.&nbsp; He know nothing of Parker, but that did not prevent
him from magnifying the new Chancellor&rsquo;s merits; on the
other hand, he <i>did</i> know Wharton, but this again did not
prevent him from prefixing to his tragedy, &ldquo;The
Revenge,&rdquo; which appeared in 1721, a dedication attributing
to the Duke all virtues, as well as all accomplishments.&nbsp; In
the concluding sentence of this dedication, Young <!-- page
212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>na&iuml;vely indicates that a considerable ingredient
in his gratitude was a lively sense of anticipated favors.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My present fortune is his bounty, and my future his care;
which I will venture to say will always be remembered to his
honor; since he, I know, intended his generosity as an
encouragement to merit, through his very pardonable partiality to
one who bears him so sincere a duty and respect, I happen to
receive the benefit of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young was economical with
his ideas and images; he was rarely satisfied with using a clever
thing once, and this bit of ingenious humility was afterward made
to do duty in the &ldquo;Instalment,&rdquo; a poem addressed to
Walpole:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be this thy partial smile, from censure
free,<br />
&rsquo;Twas meant for merit, though it fell on me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was probably &ldquo;The Revenge&rdquo; that Young was
writing when, as we learn from Spence&rsquo;s anecdotes, the Duke
of Wharton gave him a skull with a candle fixed in it, as the
most appropriate lamp by which to write tragedy.&nbsp; According
to Young&rsquo;s dedication, the Duke was &ldquo;accessory&rdquo;
to the scenes of this tragedy in a more important way, &ldquo;not
only by suggesting the most beautiful incident in them, but by
making all possible provision for the success of the
whole.&rdquo;&nbsp; A statement which is credible, not indeed on
the ground of Young&rsquo;s dedicatory assertion, but from the
known ability of the Duke, who, as Pope tells us, possessed</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;each
gift of Nature and of Art,<br />
And wanted nothing but an honest heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 1722 seems to have been the period of a visit to Mr.
Dodington, of Eastbury, in Dorsetshire&mdash;the &ldquo;pure
Dorsetian downs&rdquo; celebrated by Thomson&mdash;in which Young
made the acquaintance of Voltaire; for in the subsequent
dedication of his &ldquo;Sea Piece&rdquo; to &ldquo;Mr.
Voltaire,&rdquo; he recalls their meeting on &ldquo;Dorset
Downs;&rdquo; and it was in this year that Christopher Pitt, a
gentleman-poet of those days, addressed an <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>&ldquo;Epistle to Dr. Edward Young, at Eastbury, in
Dorsetshire,&rdquo; which has at least the merit of this
biographical couplet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While with your Dodington retired you
sit,<br />
Charm&rsquo;d with his flowing Burgundy and wit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dodington, apparently, was charmed in his turn, for he told
Dr. Wharton that Young was &ldquo;far superior to the French poet
in the variety and novelty of his <i>bon-mots</i> and
repartees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only specimen of
Young&rsquo;s wit on this occasion that has been preserved to us
is the epigram represented as an extempore retort (spoken aside,
surely) to Voltaire&rsquo;s criticism of Milton&rsquo;s episode
of sin and death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,<br
/>
At once, we think thee Milton, Death, and Sin;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>an epigram which, in the absence of &ldquo;flowing
Burgundy,&rdquo; does not strike us as remarkably
brilliant.&nbsp; Let us give Young the benefit of the doubt
thrown on the genuineness of this epigram by his own poetical
dedication, in which he represents himself as having
&ldquo;soothed&rdquo; Voltaire&rsquo;s &ldquo;rage&rdquo; against
Milton &ldquo;with gentle rhymes;&rdquo; though in other respects
that dedication is anything but favorable to a high estimate of
Young&rsquo;s wit.&nbsp; Other evidence apart, we should not be
eager for the after-dinner conversation of the man who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thine is the Drama, how renown&rsquo;d!<br
/>
Thine Epic&rsquo;s loftier trump to sound;&mdash;<br />
<i>But let Arion&rsquo;s sea-strung harp be mine</i>;<br />
<i>But where&rsquo;s his dolphin</i>?&nbsp; <i>Know&rsquo;st thou
where</i>?<br />
<i>May that be found in thee</i>, <i>Voltaire</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Satires&rdquo; appeared in 1725 and 1726, each, of
course, with its laudatory dedication and its compliments
insinuated among the rhymes.&nbsp; The seventh and last is
dedicated to Sir Robert Walpole, is very short, and contains
nothing in particular except lunatic flattery of George the First
and his prime <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>minister, attributing that royal
hog&rsquo;s late escape from a storm at sea to the miraculous
influence of his grand and virtuous soul&mdash;for George, he
says, rivals the angels:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;George, who in foes can soft affections
raise,<br />
And charm envenom&rsquo;d satire into praise.<br />
Nor human rage alone his pow&rsquo;r perceives,<br />
But the mad winds and the tumultuous waves,<br />
Ev&rsquo;n storms (Death&rsquo;s fiercest ministers!) forbear,<br
/>
And in their own wild empire learn to spare.<br />
Thus, Nature&rsquo;s self, supporting Man&rsquo;s decree,<br />
Styles Britain&rsquo;s sovereign, sovereign of the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for Walpole, what <i>he</i> felt at this tremendous
crisis</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No powers of language, but his own, can
tell,<br />
His own, which Nature and the Graces form,<br />
At will, to raise, or hush, the civil storm.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a coincidence worth noticing, that this seventh Satire
was published in 1726, and that the warrant of George the First,
granting Young a pension of &pound;200 a year from Lady-day,
1725, is dated May 3d, 1726.&nbsp; The gratitude exhibited in
this Satire may have been chiefly prospective, but the
&ldquo;Instalment,&rdquo; a poem inspired by the thrilling event
of Walpole&rsquo;s installation as Knight of the Garter, was
clearly written with the double ardor of a man who has got a
pension and hopes for something more.&nbsp; His emotion about
Walpole is precisely at the same pitch as his subsequent emotion
about the Second Advent.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Instalment&rdquo; he
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With invocations some their hearts
inflame;<br />
<i>I need no muse</i>, <i>a Walpole is my theme</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of God coming to judgment, he says, in the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I find my inspiration is my theme;<br />
<i>The grandeur of my subject is my muse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>Nothing can be feebler than this
&ldquo;Instalment,&rdquo; except in the strength of impudence
with which the writer professes to scorn the prostitution of fair
fame, the &ldquo;profanation of celestial fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert Croft tells us that Young made more than three
thousand pounds by his &ldquo;Satires&rdquo;&mdash;a surprising
statement, taken in connection with the reasonable doubt he
throws on the story related in Spence&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Anecdotes,&rdquo; that the Duke of Wharton gave Young
&pound;2000 for this work.&nbsp; Young, however, seems to have
been tolerably fortunate in the pecuniary results of his
publications; and, with his literary profits, his annuity from
Wharton, his fellowship, and his pension, not to mention other
bounties which may be inferred from the high merits he discovers
in many men of wealth and position, we may fairly suppose that he
now laid the foundation of the considerable fortune he left at
his death.</p>
<p>It is probable that the Duke of Wharton&rsquo;s final
departure for the Continent and disgrace at Court in 1726, and
the consequent cessation of Young&rsquo;s reliance on his
patronage, tended not only to heighten the temperature of his
poetical enthusiasm for Sir Robert Walpole, but also to turn his
thoughts toward the Church again, as the second-best means of
rising in the world.&nbsp; On the accession of George the Second,
Young found the same transcendent merits in him as in his
predecessor, and celebrated them in a style of poetry previously
unattempted by him&mdash;the Pindaric ode, a poetic form which
helped him to surpass himself in furious bombast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ocean, an Ode: concluding with a Wish,&rdquo; was the
title of this piece.&nbsp; He afterward pruned it, and cut off,
among other things, the concluding Wish, expressing the yearning
for humble retirement, which, of course, had prompted him to the
effusion; but we may judge of the rejected stanzas by the quality
of those he has allowed to remain.&nbsp; For example, calling on
Britain&rsquo;s dead mariners to rise and meet their
&ldquo;country&rsquo;s full-blown glory&rdquo; in the person of
the new King, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page
216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;What powerful charm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can Death disarm?<br />
Your long, your iron slumbers break?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>By Jove</i>, <i>by Fame</i>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>By George&rsquo;s name</i>,<br
/>
Awake! awake! awake! awake!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after this notable production, which was written with the
ripe folly of forty-seven, Young took orders, and was presently
appointed chaplain to the King.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Brothers,&rdquo;
his third and last tragedy, which was already in rehearsal, he
now withdrew from the stage, and sought reputation in a way more
accordant with the decorum of his new profession, by turning
prose writer.&nbsp; But after publishing &ldquo;A True Estimate
of Human Life,&rdquo; with a dedication to the Queen, as one of
the &ldquo;most shining representatives&rdquo; of God on earth,
and a sermon, entitled &ldquo;An Apology for Princes; or, the
Reverence due to Government,&rdquo; preached before the House of
Commons, his Pindaric ambition again seized him, and he matched
his former ode by another, called &ldquo;Imperium Pelagi, a Naval
Lyric; written in imitation of Pindar&rsquo;s spirit, occasioned
by his Majesty&rsquo;s return from Hanover, 1729, and the
succeeding Peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since he afterward suppressed this
second ode, we must suppose that it was rather worse than the
first.&nbsp; Next came his two &ldquo;Epistles to Pope,
concerning the Authors of the Age,&rdquo; remarkable for nothing
but the audacity of affectation with which the most servile of
poets professes to despise servility.</p>
<p>In 1730 Young was presented by his college with the rectory of
Welwyn, in Hertfordshire, and, in the following year, when he was
just fifty, he married Lady Elizabeth Lee, a widow with two
children, who seems to have been in favor with Queen Caroline,
and who probably had an income&mdash;two attractions which
doubtless enhanced the power of her other charms.&nbsp; Pastoral
duties and domesticity probably cured Young of some bad habits;
but, unhappily, they did not cure him either of flattery or of
fustian.&nbsp; Three more odes followed, <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>quite as
bad as those of his bachelorhood, except that in the third he
announced the wise resolution of never writing another.&nbsp; It
must have been about this time, since Young was now &ldquo;turned
of fifty,&rdquo; that he wrote the letter to Mrs. Howard
(afterward Lady Suffolk), George the Second&rsquo;s mistress,
which proves that he used other engines, besides Pindaric ones,
in &ldquo;besieging Court favor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter is too
characteristic to be omitted:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Monday

<p>Young&rsquo;s wife died in 1741, leaving him one son, born in
1733.&nbsp; That he had attached himself strongly to her two
daughters by her former marriage, there is better evidence in the
report, mentioned by Mrs. Montagu, of his practical kindness and
liberality to the younger, than in his lamentations over the
elder as the &ldquo;Narcissa&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Narcissa&rdquo; had died in 1735,
shortly after marriage to Mr. Temple, the son of Lord Palmerston;
and Mr. Temple himself, after a second marriage, died in 1740, a
year before Lady Elizabeth Young.&nbsp; These, then, are the
three deaths supposed to have inspired &ldquo;The
Complaint,&rdquo; which forms the three first books of the
&ldquo;Night Thoughts:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Insatiate archer, could not one suffice?<br
/>
Thy shaft flew thrice: and thrice my peace was slain:<br />
And thrice, ere thrice yon moon had fill&rsquo;d her
horn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we find Young departing from the truth of dates, in
order to heighten the effect of his calamity, or at least of his
climax, we need not be surprised that he allowed his imagination
great freedom in other matters besides chronology, and that the
character of &ldquo;Philander&rdquo; can, by no process, be made
to fit Mr. Temple.&nbsp; The supposition that the much-lectured
&ldquo;Lorenzo&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; was
Young&rsquo;s own son is hardly rendered more absurd by the fact
that the poem was written when that son was a boy, than by the
obvious artificiality of the characters Young introduces as
targets for his arguments and rebukes.&nbsp; Among all the
trivial efforts of conjectured criticism, there can hardly be one
more futile than the attempts to discover the original of those
pitiable lay-figures, the &ldquo;Lorenzos&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Altamonts&rdquo; of Young&rsquo;s didactic prose and
poetry.&nbsp; His muse never stood face to face with a genuine
<!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>living human being; she would have been as much
startled by such an encounter as a necromancer whose incantations
and blue fire had actually conjured up a demon.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; appeared between 1741 and
1745.&nbsp; Although he declares in them that he has chosen God
for his &ldquo;patron&rdquo; henceforth, this is not at all to
the prejudice of some half dozen lords, duchesses, and right
honorables who have the privilege of sharing finely-turned
compliments with their co-patron.&nbsp; The line which closed the
Second Night in the earlier editions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wits spare not Heaven, O
Wilmington!&mdash;nor thee&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is an intense specimen of that perilous juxtaposition of ideas
by which Young, in his incessant search after point and novelty,
unconsciously converts his compliments into sarcasms; and his
apostrophe to the moon as more likely to be favorable to his song
if he calls her &ldquo;fair Portland of the skies,&rdquo; is
worthy even of his Pindaric ravings.&nbsp; His ostentatious
renunciation of worldly schemes, and especially of his
twenty-years&rsquo; siege of Court favor, are in the tone of one
who retains some hope in the midst of his querulousness.</p>
<p>He descended from the astronomical rhapsodies of his
&ldquo;Ninth Night,&rdquo; published in 1745, to more terrestrial
strains in his &ldquo;Reflections on the Public Situation of the
Kingdom,&rdquo; dedicated to the Duke of Newcastle; but in this
critical year we get a glimpse of him through a more prosaic and
less refracting medium.&nbsp; He spent a part of the year at
Tunbridge Wells; and Mrs. Montagu, who was there too, gives a
very lively picture of the &ldquo;divine Doctor&rdquo; in her
letters to the Duchess of Portland, on whom Young had bestowed
the superlative bombast to which we have recently alluded.&nbsp;
We shall borrow the quotations from Dr. Doran, in spite of their
length, because, to our mind, they present the most agreeable
portrait we possess of Young:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have great joy in Dr. Young, whom I
disturbed in a reverie.&nbsp; At first he started, then bowed,
then fell back into a surprise; then <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>began a
speech, relapsed into his astonishment two or three times, forgot
what he had been saying; began a new subject, and so went
on.&nbsp; I told him your grace desired he would write longer
letters; to which he cried &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; most emphatically,
and I leave you to interpret what it meant.&nbsp; He has made a
friendship with one person here, whom I believe you would not
imagine to have been made for his bosom friend.&nbsp; You would,
perhaps, suppose it was a bishop or dean, a prebend, a pious
preacher, a clergyman of exemplary life, or, if a layman, of most
virtuous conversation, one that had paraphrased St. Matthew, or
wrote comments on St. Paul. . . . You would not guess that this
associate of the doctor&rsquo;s was&mdash;old Cibber!&nbsp;
Certainly, in their religious, moral, and civil character, there
is no relation; but in their dramatic capacity there is
some.&mdash;Mrs. Montagu was not aware that Cibber, whom Young
had named not disparagingly in his Satires, was the brother of
his old school-fellow; but to return to our hero.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The waters,&rsquo; says Mrs. Montagu, &lsquo;have raised
his spirits to a fine pitch, as your grace will imagine, when I
tell you how sublime an answer he made to a very vulgar
question.&nbsp; I asked him how long he stayed at the Wells; he
said, &lsquo;As long as my rival stayed;&mdash;as long as the sun
did.&rsquo;&nbsp; Among the visitors at the Wells were Lady
Sunderland (wife of Sir Robert Sutton), and her sister, Mrs.
Tichborne.&nbsp; &lsquo;He did an admirable thing to Lady
Sunderland: on her mentioning Sir Robert Sutton, he asked her
where Sir Robert&rsquo;s lady was; on which we all laughed very
heartily, and I brought him off, half ashamed, to my lodgings,
where, during breakfast, he assured me he had asked after Lady
Sunderland, because he had a great honor for her; and that,
having a respect for her sister, he designed to have inquired
after her, if we had not put it out of his head by laughing at
him.&nbsp; You must know, Mrs. Tichborne sat next to Lady
Sunderland.&nbsp; It would have been admirable to have had him
finish his compliment in that manner.&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;His
expressions all bear the stamp of novelty, and his thoughts of
sterling sense.&nbsp; He practises a kind of philosophical
abstinence. . . . He carried Mrs. Rolt and myself to Tunbridge,
five miles from hence, where we were to see some fine old
ruins.&nbsp; First rode the doctor on a tall steed, decently
caparisoned in dark gray; next, ambled Mrs. Rolt on a hackney
horse; . . . then followed your humble servant on a milk-white
palfrey.&nbsp; I rode on in safety, and at leisure to observe the
company, especially the two figures that brought up the
rear.&nbsp; The first was my servant, valiantly armed with two
uncharged pistols; the last was the doctor&rsquo;s man, whose
uncombed hair so resembled the mane of the horse he rode, <!--
page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>one could not help imagining they were of kin, and
wishing, for the honor of the family, that they had had one comb
betwixt them.&nbsp; On his head was a velvet cap, much resembling
a black saucepan, and on his side hung a little basket.&nbsp; At
last we arrived at the King&rsquo;s Head, where the loyalty of
the doctor induced him to alight; and then, knight-errant-like,
he took his damsels from off their palfreys, and courteously
handed us into the inn.&rsquo; . . . The party returned to the
Wells; and &lsquo;the silver Cynthia held up her lamp in the
heavens&rsquo; the while.&nbsp; &lsquo;The night silenced all but
our divine doctor, who sometimes uttered things fit to be spoken
in a season when all nature seems to be hushed and
hearkening.&nbsp; I followed, gathering wisdom as I went, till I
found, by my horse&rsquo;s stumbling, that I was in a bad road,
and that the blind was leading the blind.&nbsp; So I placed my
servant between the doctor and myself; which he not perceiving,
went on in a most philosophical strain, to the great admiration
of my poor clown of a servant, who, not being wrought up to any
pitch of enthusiasm, nor making any answer to all the fine things
he heard, the doctor, wondering I was dumb, and grieving I was so
stupid, looked round and declared his surprise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young&rsquo;s oddity and absence of mind are gathered from
other sources besides these stories of Mrs. Montagu&rsquo;s, and
gave rise to the report that he was the original of
Fielding&rsquo;s &ldquo;Parson Adams;&rdquo; but this Croft
denies, and mentions another Young, who really sat for the
portrait, and who, we imagine, had both more Greek and more
genuine simplicity than the poet.&nbsp; His love of chatting with
Colley Cibber was an indication that the old predilection for the
stage survived, in spite of his emphatic contempt for &ldquo;all
joys but joys that never can expire;&rdquo; and the production of
&ldquo;The Brothers,&rdquo; at Drury Lane in 1753, after a
suppression of fifteen years, was perhaps not entirely due to the
expressed desire to give the proceeds to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s profits were
not more than &pound;400&mdash;in those days a disappointing sum;
and Young, as we learn from his friend Richardson, did not make
this the limit of his donation, but gave a thousand guineas to
the Society.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had some talk with him,&rdquo; says
Richardson, in one of his letters, &ldquo;about this great
action.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;intended to
do something handsome for <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>the
Society.&nbsp; Had I deferred it to my demise, I should have
given away my son&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; All the world are inclined
to pleasure; could I have given myself a greater by disposing of
the sum to a different use, I should have done
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely he took his old friend Richardson
for &ldquo;Lorenzo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His next work was &ldquo;The Centaur not Fabulous; in Six
Letters to a Friend, on the Life in Vogue,&rdquo; which reads
very much like the most objurgatory parts of the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts&rdquo; reduced to prose.&nbsp; It is preceded by a
preface which, though addressed to a lady, is in its
denunciations of vice as grossly indecent and almost as flippant
as the epilogues written by &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; which he
allowed to be reprinted after his tragedies in the latest edition
of his works.&nbsp; We like much better than &ldquo;The
Centaur,&rdquo; &ldquo;Conjectures on Original
Composition,&rdquo; written in 1759, for the sake, he says, of
communicating to the world the well-known anecdote about
Addison&rsquo;s deathbed, and with the exception of his poem on
Resignation, the last thing he ever published.</p>
<p>The estrangement from his son, which must have embittered the
later years of his life, appears to have begun not many years
after the mother&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; On the marriage of her
second daughter, who had previously presided over Young&rsquo;s
household, a Mrs. Hallows, understood to be a woman of discreet
age, and the daughter (a widow) of a clergyman who was an old
friend of Young&rsquo;s, became housekeeper at Welwyn.&nbsp;
Opinions about ladies are apt to differ.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs.
Hallows was a woman of piety, improved by reading,&rdquo; says
one witness.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was a very coarse woman,&rdquo;
says Dr. Johnson; and we shall presently find some indirect
evidence that her temper was perhaps not quite so much improved
as her piety.&nbsp; Servants, it seems, were not fond of
remaining long in the house with her; a satirical curate, named
Kidgell, hints at &ldquo;drops of juniper&rdquo; taken as a
cordial (but perhaps he was spiteful, and a teetotaller); and
Young&rsquo;s son is said to have told his father that &ldquo;an
old man should not resign himself to the management of
anybody.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result was, that the son was banished
from home for the <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>rest of his father&rsquo;s
life-time, though Young seems never to have thought of
disinheriting him.</p>
<p>Our latest glimpses of the aged poet are derived from certain
letters of Mr. Jones, his curate&mdash;letters preserved in the
British Museum, and happily made accessible to common mortals in
Nichols&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anecdotes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Jones was a
man of some literary activity and ambition&mdash;a collector of
interesting documents, and one of those concerned in the
&ldquo;Free and Candid Disquisitions,&rdquo; the design of which
was &ldquo;to point out such things in our ecclesiastical
establishment as want to be reviewed and amended.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
these and kindred subjects he corresponded with Dr. Birch,
occasionally troubling him with queries and manuscripts.&nbsp; We
have a respect for Mr. Jones.&nbsp; Unlike any person who ever
troubled <i>us</i> with queries or manuscripts, he mitigates the
infliction by such gifts as &ldquo;a fat pullet,&rdquo; wishing
he &ldquo;had anything better to send; but this depauperizing
vicarage (of Alconbury) too often checks the freedom and
forwardness of my mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another day comes a
&ldquo;pound canister of tea,&rdquo; another, a &ldquo;young
fatted goose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly, Mr. Jones was entirely unlike
your literary correspondents of the present day; he forwarded
manuscripts, but he had &ldquo;bowels,&rdquo; and forwarded
poultry too.&nbsp; His first letter from Welwyn is dated June,
1759, not quite six years before Young&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; In
June, 1762, he expresses a wish to go to London &ldquo;this
summer.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My time and pains are almost continually
taken up here, and . . . I have been (I now find) a considerable
loser, upon the whole, by continuing here so long.&nbsp; The
consideration of this, and the inconveniences I sustained, and do
still experience, from my late illness, obliged me at last to
acquaint the Doctor (Young) with my case, and to assure him that
I plainly perceived the duty and confinement here to be too much
for me; for which reason I must (I said) beg to be at liberty to
resign my charge at Michaelmas.&nbsp; I began to give him these
notices in February, when I was very ill; and now I perceive, by
what he told me the other day, that he is in some difficulty: for
which reason he is at last (he says) resolved to advertise,
<i>and even</i> (<i>which is much wondered at</i>) <i>to raise
the salary considerably </i><!-- page 224--><a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span><i>higher</i>.&nbsp; (What he allowed my predecessors
was 20<i>l.</i> per annum; and now he proposes 50<i>l.</i>, as he
tells me.)&nbsp; I never asked him to raise it for me, though I
well knew it was not equal to the duty; nor did I say a word
about myself when he lately suggested to me his intentions upon
this subject.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a postscript to this letter he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I may mention to you farther, as a friend
that may be trusted, that in all likelihood the poor old
gentleman will not find it a very easy matter, unless by dint of
money, <i>and force upon himself</i>, to procure a man that he
can like for his next curate, <i>nor one that will stay with him
so long as I have done</i>.&nbsp; Then, his great age will recur
to people&rsquo;s thoughts; and if he has any foibles, either in
temper or conduct, they will be sure not to be forgotten on this
occasion by those who know him; and those who do not will
probably be on their guard.&nbsp; On these and the like
considerations, it is by no means an eligible office to be
seeking out for a curate for him, as he has several times wished
me to do; and would, if he knew that I am now writing to you,
wish your assistance also.&nbsp; But my best friends here, <i>who
well foresee the probable consequences</i>, and wish me well,
earnestly dissuade me from complying: and I will decline the
office with as much decency as I can: but high salary will, I
suppose, fetch in somebody or other, soon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following July he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The old gentleman here (I may venture to
tell you freely) seems to me to be in a pretty odd way of
late&mdash;moping, dejected, self-willed, and as if surrounded
with some perplexing circumstances.&nbsp; Though I visit him
pretty frequently for short intervals, I say very little to his
affairs, not choosing to be a party concerned, especially in
cases of so critical and tender a nature.&nbsp; There is much
mystery in almost all his temporal affairs, as well as in many of
his speculative theories.&nbsp; Whoever lives in this
neighborhood to see his exit will probably see and hear some very
strange things.&nbsp; Time will show;&mdash;I am afraid, not
greatly to his credit.&nbsp; There is thought to be <i>an
irremovable obstruction to his happiness within his walls</i>,
<i>as well as another without them</i>; but the former is the
more powerful, and like to continue so.&nbsp; He has this day
been trying anew to engage me to stay with him.&nbsp; No
lucrative views can tempt me to sacrifice my liberty or my
health, to such measures as are proposed here.&nbsp; <i>Nor do I
like to </i><!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span><i>have to do with persons whose
word and honor cannot be depended on</i>.&nbsp; So much for this
very odd and unhappy topic.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August Mr. Jones&rsquo;s tone is slightly modified.&nbsp;
Earnest entreaties, not lucrative considerations, have induced
him to cheer the Doctor&rsquo;s dejected heart by remaining at
Welwyn some time longer.&nbsp; The Doctor is, &ldquo;in various
respects, a very unhappy man,&rdquo; and few know so much of
these respects as Mr. Jones.&nbsp; In September he recurs to the
subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My ancient gentleman here is still full of
trouble, which moves my concern, though it moves only the secret
laughter of many, and some untoward surmises in disfavor of him
and his household.&nbsp; The loss of a very large sum of money
(about 200<i>l.</i>) is talked of; whereof this vill and
neighborhood is full.&nbsp; Some disbelieve; others says,
&lsquo;<i>It is no wonder</i>, <i>where about eighteen or more
servants are sometimes taken and dismissed in the course of a
year</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The gentleman himself is allowed by all to
be far more harmless and easy in his family than some one else
who hath too much the lead in it.&nbsp; This, among others, was
one reason for my late motion to quit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other mention of Young&rsquo;s affairs occurs until April
2d, 1765, when he says that Dr. Young is very ill, attended by
two physicians.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having mentioned this young gentleman (Dr.
Young&rsquo;s son), I would acquaint you next, that he came
hither this morning, having been sent for, as I am told, by the
direction of Mrs. Hallows.&nbsp; Indeed, she intimated to me as
much herself.&nbsp; And if this be so, I must say, that it is one
of the most prudent Acts she ever did, or could have done in such
a case as this; as it may prove a means of preventing much
confusion after the death of the Doctor.&nbsp; I have had some
little discourse with the son: he seems much affected, and I
believe really is so.&nbsp; He earnestly wishes his father might
be pleased to ask after him; for you must know he has not yet
done this, nor is, in my opinion, like to do it.&nbsp; And it has
been said farther, that upon a late application made to him on
the behalf of his son, he desired that no more might be said to
him about it.&nbsp; How true this may be I cannot as yet be
certain; all I shall say is, it seems not improbable . . . I
heartily wish the ancient man&rsquo;s heart may prove tender
toward his son; <i>though</i>, <i>knowing him so well</i>, <i>I
can scarce hope to hear such desirable news</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have now the pleasure to acquaint you,
that the late Dr. Young, though he had for many years kept his
son at a distance from him, yet has now at last left him all his
possessions, after the payment of certain legacies; so that the
young gentleman (who bears a fair character, and behaves well, as
far as I can hear or see) will, I hope, soon enjoy and make a
prudent use of a handsome fortune.&nbsp; The father, on his
deathbed, and since my return from London, was applied to in the
tenderest manner, by one of his physicians, and by another
person, to admit the son into his presence, to make submission,
intreat forgiveness, and obtain his blessing.&nbsp; As to an
interview with his son, he intimated that he chose to decline it,
as his spirits were then low and his nerves weak.&nbsp; With
regard to the next particular, he said, &lsquo;<i>I heartily
forgive him</i>;&rsquo; and upon &lsquo;mention of this last, he
gently lifted up his hand, and letting it gently fall, pronounced
these words, &lsquo;<i>God bless him</i>!&rsquo; . . . I know it
will give you pleasure to be farther informed that he was pleased
to make respectful mention of me in his will; expressing his
satisfaction in my care of his parish, <i>bequeathing to me a
handsome legacy</i>, and appointing me to be one of his
executors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far Mr. Jones, in his confidential correspondence with a
&ldquo;friend, who may be trusted.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a letter
communicated apparently by him to the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, seven years later, namely, in 1782, on the
appearance of Croft&rsquo;s biography of Young, we find him
speaking of &ldquo;the ancient gentleman&rdquo; in a tone of
reverential eulogy, quite at variance with the free comments we
have just quoted.&nbsp; But the Rev. John Jones was probably of
opinion, with Mrs. Montagu, whose contemporary and retrospective
letters are also set in a different key, that &ldquo;the
interests of religion were connected with the character of a man
so distinguished for piety as Dr. Young.&rdquo;&nbsp; At all
events, a subsequent quasi-official statement weighs nothing as
evidence against contemporary, spontaneous, and confidential
hints.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Hallows, Young left a legacy of &pound;1000, with the
request that she would destroy all his manuscripts.&nbsp; This
final request, from some unknown cause, was not complied with,
and among the papers he left behind him was the following <!--
page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>letter from Archbishop Secker, which probably marks the
date of his latest effort after preferment:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Deanery of St. Paul&rsquo;s</span>, July 8,
1758.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good <span class="smcap">Dr. Young</span>: I have long
wondered that more suitable notice of your great merit hath not
been taken by persons in power.&nbsp; But how to remedy the
omission I see not.&nbsp; No encouragement hath ever been given
me to mention things of this nature to his Majesty.&nbsp; And
therefore, in all likelihood, the only consequence of doing it
would be weakening the little influence which else I may possibly
have on some other occasions.&nbsp; <i>Your fortune and your
reputation set you above the need of advancement</i>; <i>and your
sentiments above that concern for it</i>, <i>on your own
account</i>, which, on that of the public, is sincerely felt
by</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your loving Brother,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tho.
Cant.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The loving brother&rsquo;s irony is severe!</p>
<p>Perhaps the least questionable testimony to the better side of
Young&rsquo;s character is that of Bishop Hildesley, who, as the
vicar of a parish near Welwyn, had been Young&rsquo;s neighbor
for upward of twenty years.&nbsp; The affection of the clergy for
each other, we have observed, is, like that of the fair sex, not
at all of a blind and infatuated kind; and we may therefore the
rather believe them when they give each other any extra-official
praise.&nbsp; Bishop Hildesley, then writing of Young to
Richardson, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The impertinence of my frequent visits to
him was amply rewarded; forasmuch as, I can truly say, he never
received me but with agreeable open complacency; and I never left
him but with profitable pleasure and improvement.&nbsp; He was
one or other, the most modest, the most patient of contradiction,
and the most informing and entertaining I ever conversed
with&mdash;at least, of any man who had so just pretensions to
pertinacity and reserve.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Langton, however, who was also a frequent visitor of
Young&rsquo;s, informed Boswell&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That there was an air of benevolence in his
manner; but that he could obtain from him less information than
he had hoped to receive from one who had lived so much in
intercourse with the brightest <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>men of what
had been called the Augustan age of England; and that he showed a
degree of eager curiosity concerning the common occurrences that
were then passing, which appeared somewhat remarkable in a man of
such intellectual stores, of such an advanced age, and who had
retired from life with declared disappointment in his
expectations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same substance, we know, will exhibit different qualities
under different tests; and, after all, imperfect reports of
individual impressions, whether immediate or traditional, are a
very frail basis on which to build our opinion of a man.&nbsp;
One&rsquo;s character may be very indifferently mirrored in the
mind of the most intimate neighbor; it all depends on the quality
of that gentleman&rsquo;s reflecting surface.</p>
<p>But, discarding any inferences from such uncertain evidence,
the outline of Young&rsquo;s character is too distinctly
traceable in the well-attested facts of his life, and yet more in
the self-betrayal that runs through all his works, for us to fear
that our general estimate of him may be false.&nbsp; For, while
no poet seems less easy and spontaneous than Young, no poet
discloses himself more completely.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s minds have
no hiding-place out of themselves&mdash;their affectations do but
betray another phase of their nature.&nbsp; And if, in the
present view of Young, we seem to be more intent on laying bare
unfavorable facts than on shrouding them in &ldquo;charitable
speeches,&rdquo; it is not because we have any irreverential
pleasure in turning men&rsquo;s characters &ldquo;the seamy side
without,&rdquo; but because we see no great advantage in
considering a man as he was <i>not</i>.&nbsp; Young&rsquo;s
biographers and critics have usually set out from the position
that he was a great religious teacher, and that his poetry is
morally sublime; and they have toned down his failings into
harmony with their conception of the divine and the poet.&nbsp;
For our own part, we set out from precisely the opposite
conviction&mdash;namely, that the religious and moral spirit of
Young&rsquo;s poetry is low and false, and we think it of some
importance to show that the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; are the
reflex of the mind in which the higher human sympathies were
inactive.&nbsp; This <!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>judgment is entirely opposed to our
youthful predilections and enthusiasm.&nbsp; The sweet
garden-breath of early enjoyment lingers about many a page of the
&ldquo;Night Thoughts,&rdquo; and even of the &ldquo;Last
Day,&rdquo; giving an extrinsic charm to passages of stilted
rhetoric and false sentiment; but the sober and repeated reading
of maturer years has convinced us that it would hardly be
possible to find a more typical instance than Young&rsquo;s
poetry, of the mistake which substitutes interested obedience for
sympathetic emotion, and baptizes egoism as religion.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Pope said of Young, that he had &ldquo;much of a sublime
genius without common-sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deficiency Pope
meant to indicate was, we imagine, moral rather than
intellectual: it was the want of that fine sense of what is
fitting in speech and action, which is often eminently possessed
by men and women whose intellect is of a very common order, but
who have the sincerity and dignity which can never coexist with
the selfish preoccupations of vanity or interest.&nbsp; This was
the &ldquo;common-sense&rdquo; in which Young was conspicuously
deficient; and it was partly owing to this deficiency that his
genius, waiting to be determined by the highest prize, fluttered
uncertainly from effort to effort, until, when he was more than
sixty, it suddenly spread its broad wing, and soared so as to
arrest the gaze of other generations besides his own.&nbsp; For
he had no versatility of faculty to mislead him.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; only differ from his previous works
in the degree and not in the kind of power they manifest.&nbsp;
Whether he writes prose or poetry, rhyme or blank verse, dramas,
satires, odes, or meditations, we see everywhere the same
Young&mdash;the same narrow circle of thoughts, the same love of
abstractions, the same telescopic view of human things, the same
appetency toward antithetic apothegm and rhapsodic climax.&nbsp;
The passages that arrest us in his tragedies are those in which
he anticipates some fine passage in the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts,&rdquo; and where his characters are only transparent
shadows through which we see the bewigged <i>embonpoint</i> of
the didactic poet, excogitating epigrams or ecstatic <!-- page
230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>soliloquies by the light of a candle fixed in a
skull.&nbsp; Thus, in &ldquo;The Revenge,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Alonzo,&rdquo; in the conflict of jealousy and love that
at once urges and forbids him to murder his wife, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This vast and solid earth, that blazing
sun,<br />
Those skies, through which it rolls, must all have end.<br />
What then is man?&nbsp; The smallest part of nothing.<br />
Day buries day; month, month; and year the year!<br />
Our life is but a chain of many deaths.<br />
Can then Death&rsquo;s self be feared?&nbsp; Our life much
rather:<br />
<i>Life is the desert</i>, <i>life the solitude</i>;<br />
Death joins us to the great majority;<br />
&rsquo;Tis to be born to Plato and to C&aelig;sar;<br />
&rsquo;Tis to be great forever;<br />
&rsquo;Tis pleasure, &rsquo;tis ambition, then, to
die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His prose writings all read like the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts,&rdquo; either diluted into prose or not yet
crystallized into poetry.&nbsp; For example, in his
&ldquo;Thoughts for Age,&rdquo; he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though we stand on its awful brink, such
our leaden bias to the world, we turn our faces the wrong way; we
are still looking on our old acquaintance, <i>Time</i>; though
now so wasted and reduced, that we can see little more of him
than his wings and his scythe: our age enlarges his wings to our
imagination; and our fear of death, his scythe; as Time himself
grows less.&nbsp; His consumption is deep; his annihilation is at
hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a dilution of the magnificent image&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Time in advance behind him hides his
wings,<br />
And seems to creep decrepit with his age.<br />
Behold him when past by!&nbsp; What then is seen<br />
But his proud pinions, swifter than the winds?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A requesting Omnipotence?&nbsp; What can
stun and confound thy reason more?&nbsp; What more can ravish and
exalt thy heart?&nbsp; It cannot but ravish and exalt; it cannot
but gloriously disturb and perplex thee, to take in all
<i>that</i> suggests.&nbsp; Thou child of the dust!&nbsp; Thou
speck of misery and sin!&nbsp; How abject thy weakness! how great
is thy power!&nbsp; Thou crawler on earth, and possible (I was
about to say) controller of the skies!&nbsp; Weigh, and weigh
well, the wondrous truths I have in view: which cannot be weighed
too much; which <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>the more they are weighed, amaze the
more; which to have supposed, before they were revealed, would
have been as great madness, and to have presumed on as great sin,
as it is now madness and sin not to believe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in his Pindaric odes, in which he made the most violent
efforts against nature, he is still neither more nor less than
the Young of the &ldquo;Last Day,&rdquo; emptied and swept of his
genius, and possessed by seven demons of fustian and bad
rhyme.&nbsp; Even here his &ldquo;Ercles&rsquo; Vein&rdquo;
alternates with his moral platitudes, and we have the perpetual
text of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gold pleasure buys;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But pleasure dies,<br />
For soon the gross fruition cloys;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though raptures court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sense is short;<br />
But virtue kindles living joys;&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Joys felt alone!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Joys asked of none!<br />
Which Time&rsquo;s and fortune&rsquo;s arrows miss:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Joys that subsist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though fates resist,<br />
An unprecarious, endless bliss!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unhappy they!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And falsely gay!<br />
Who bask forever in success;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A constant feast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite palls the taste,<br />
<i>And long enjoyment is distress</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the &ldquo;Last Day,&rdquo; again, which is the earliest
thing he wrote, we have an anticipation of all his greatest
faults and merits.&nbsp; Conspicuous among the faults is that
attempt to exalt our conceptions of Deity by vulgar images and
comparisons, which is so offensive in the later &ldquo;Night
Thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a burst of prayer and homage to God,
called forth by the contemplation of Christ coming to judgment,
he asks, Who brings the change of the seasons? and answers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not the great Ottoman, or Greater Czar;<br
/>
Not Europe&rsquo;s arbitress of peace and war!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Conceive the soul in its most solemn moments, assuring
God that it doesn&rsquo;t place his power below that of Louis
Napoleon or Queen Victoria!</p>
<p>But in the midst of uneasy rhymes, inappropriate imagery,
vaulting sublimity that o&rsquo;erleaps itself, and vulgar
emotions, we have in this poem an occasional flash of genius, a
touch of simple grandeur, which promises as much as Young ever
achieved.&nbsp; Describing the on-coming of the dissolution of
all things, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No sun in radiant glory shines on high;<br
/>
<i>No light but from the terrors of the sky</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, speaking of great armies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whose rear lay wrapt in night, while
breaking dawn<br />
Rous&rsquo;d the broad front, and call&rsquo;d the battle
on.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this wail of the lost souls is fine:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And
this for sin?<br />
Could I offend if I had never been?<br />
But still increas&rsquo;d the senseless, happy mass,<br />
Flow&rsquo;d in the stream, <i>or shiver&rsquo;d in the
grass</i>?<br />
Father of mercies!&nbsp; Why from silent earth<br />
Didst thou awake and curse me into birth?<br />
Tear me from quiet, ravish me from night,<br />
And make a thankless present of thy light?<br />
Push into being a reverse of Thee,<br />
And <i>animate a clod with misery</i>?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is seldom in Young&rsquo;s rhymed poems that the effect
of a felicitous thought or image is not counteracted by our sense
of the constraint he suffered from the necessities of
rhyme&mdash;that &ldquo;Gothic demon,&rdquo; as he afterward
called it, &ldquo;which, modern poetry tasting, became
mortal.&rdquo;&nbsp; In relation to his own power, no one will
question the truth of this dictum, that &ldquo;blank verse is
verse unfallen, uncurst; verse reclaimed, reinthroned in the true
language of the gods; who never thundered nor suffered their
Homer to thunder in rhyme.&rdquo;&nbsp; His want of mastery in
rhyme is especially a drawback on the effects of his Satires; for
epigrams and witticisms are peculiarly susceptible to the
intrusion of a superfluous word, or to an inversion which implies
constraint.&nbsp; Here, even more than elsewhere, <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>the art that conceals art is an absolute requisite, and
to have a witticism presented to us in limping or cumbrous rhythm
is as counteractive to any electrifying effect as to see the
tentative grimaces by which a comedian prepares a grotesque
countenance.&nbsp; We discern the process, instead of being
startled by the result.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the Satires, read <i>seriatim</i>, have
a flatness to us, which, when we afterward read picked passages,
we are inclined to disbelieve in, and to attribute to some
deficiency in our own mood.&nbsp; But there are deeper reasons
for that dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Young is not a satirist of a high
order.&nbsp; His satire has neither the terrible vigor, the
lacerating energy of genuine indignation, nor the humor which
owns loving fellowship with the poor human nature it laughs at;
nor yet the personal bitterness which, as in Pope&rsquo;s
characters of Sporus and Atticus, insures those living touches by
virtue of which the individual and particular in Art becomes the
universal and immortal.&nbsp; Young could never describe a real,
complex human being; but what he <i>could</i> do with eminent
success was to describe, with neat and finished point, obvious
<i>types</i>, of manners rather than of character&mdash;to write
cold and clever epigrams on personified vices and
absurdities.&nbsp; There is no more emotion in his satire than if
he were turning witty verses on a waxen image of Cupid or a
lady&rsquo;s glove.&nbsp; He has none of these felicitious
epithets, none of those pregnant lines, by which Pope&rsquo;s
Satires have enriched the ordinary speech of educated men.&nbsp;
Young&rsquo;s wit will be found in almost every instance to
consist in that antithetic combination of ideas which, of all the
forms of wit, is most within reach of a clever effort.&nbsp; In
his gravest arguments, as well as in his lightest satire, one
might imagine that he had set himself to work out the problem,
how much antithesis might be got out of a given subject.&nbsp;
And there he completely succeeds.&nbsp; His neatest portraits are
all wrought on this plan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Narcissus,&rdquo; for
example, who</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Omits no duty; nor can Envy say<br />
He miss&rsquo;d, these many years, the Church or Play:<br />
<!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>He makes no noise in Parliament, &rsquo;tis true;<br />
But pays his debts, and visit when &rsquo;tis due;<br />
His character and gloves are ever clean,<br />
And then he can out-bow the bowing Dean;<br />
A smile eternal on his lip he wears,<br />
Which equally the wise and worthless shares.<br />
In gay fatigues, this most undaunted chief,<br />
Patient of idleness beyond belief,<br />
Most charitably lends the town his face<br />
For ornament in every public place;<br />
As sure as cards he to th&rsquo; assembly comes,<br />
And is the furniture of drawing-rooms:<br />
When Ombre calls, his hand and heart are free,<br />
And, joined to two, he fails not&mdash;to make three;<br />
Narcissus is the glory of his race;<br />
For who does nothing with a better grace?<br />
To deck my list by nature were designed<br />
Such shining expletives of human kind,<br />
Who want, while through blank life they dream along,<br />
Sense to be right and passion to be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is but seldom that we find a touch of that easy slyness
which gives an additional zest to surprise; but here is an
instance:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See Tityrus, with merriment possest,<br />
Is burst with laughter ere he hears the jest,<br />
What need he stay, for when the joke is o&rsquo;er,<br />
His <i>teeth</i> will be no whiter than before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Pope, whom he imitated, he sets out with a psychological
mistake as the basis of his satire, attributing all forms of
folly to one passion&mdash;the love of fame, or vanity&mdash;a
much grosser mistake, indeed, than Pope&rsquo;s, exaggeration of
the extent to which the &ldquo;ruling passion&rdquo; determines
conduct in the individual.&nbsp; Not that Young is consistent in
his mistake.&nbsp; He sometimes implies no more than what is the
truth&mdash;that the love of fame is the cause, not of all
follies, but of many.</p>
<p>Young&rsquo;s satires on women are superior to Pope&rsquo;s,
which is only saying that they are superior to Pope&rsquo;s
greatest failure.&nbsp; We can more frequently pick out a couplet
as successful than an entire sketch.&nbsp; Of the too emphatic
&ldquo;Syrena&rdquo; he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Her judgment just, her sentence is too
strong;<br />
Because she&rsquo;s right, she&rsquo;s ever in the
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the diplomatic &ldquo;Julia:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>&ldquo;For her own breakfast
she&rsquo;ll project a scheme,<br />
Nor take her tea without a stratagem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of &ldquo;Lyce,&rdquo; the old painted coquette:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In vain the cock has summoned sprites
away;<br />
She walks at noon and blasts the bloom of day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the nymph, who, &ldquo;gratis, clears religious
mysteries:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis hard, too, she who makes no use
but chat<br />
Of her religion, should be barr&rsquo;d in that.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description of the literary <i>belle</i>,
&ldquo;Daphne,&rdquo; well prefaces that of &ldquo;Stella,&rdquo;
admired by Johnson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With legs toss&rsquo;d high, on her sophee
she sits,<br />
Vouchsafing audience to contending wits:<br />
Of each performance she&rsquo;s the final test;<br />
One act read o&rsquo;er, she prophecies the rest;<br />
And then, pronouncing with decisive air,<br />
Fully convinces all the town&mdash;<i>she&rsquo;s fair</i>.<br />
Had lonely Daphne Hecatessa&rsquo;s face,<br />
How would her elegance of taste decrease!<br />
Some ladies&rsquo; judgment in their features lies,<br />
And all their genius sparkles in their eyes.<br />
But hold, she cries, lampooner! have a care;<br />
Must I want common sense because I&rsquo;m fair?<br />
O no; see Stella: her eyes shine as bright<br />
As if her tongue was never in the right;<br />
And yet what real learning, judgment, fire!<br />
She seems inspir&rsquo;d, and can herself inspire.<br />
How then (if malice ruled not all the fair)<br />
<i>Could Daphne publish</i>, <i>and could she
forbear</i>?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, when we have gone through Young&rsquo;s seven
Satires, we seem to have made but an indifferent meal.&nbsp; They
are a sort of fricassee, with some little solid meat in them, and
yet the flavor is not always piquant.&nbsp; It is curious to find
him, when he pauses a moment from his satiric sketching,
recurring to his old platitudes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can gold calm passion, or make reason
shine?<br />
Can we dig peace or wisdom from the mine?<br />
Wisdom to gold prefer;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>platitudes which he seems inevitably to fall into, for the
same reason that some men are constantly asserting their contempt
for criticism&mdash;because he felt the opposite so keenly.</p>
<p><!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>The outburst of genius in the earlier books of the
&ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; is the more remarkable, that in the
interval between them and the Satires he had produced nothing but
his Pindaric odes, in which he fell far below the level of his
previous works.&nbsp; Two sources of this sudden strength were
the freedom of blank verse and the presence of a genuine
emotion.&nbsp; Most persons, in speaking of the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts,&rdquo; have in their minds only the two or three first
Nights, the majority of readers rarely getting beyond these,
unless, as Wilson says, they &ldquo;have but few books, are poor,
and live in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in these earlier Nights
there is enough genuine sublimity and genuine sadness to bribe us
into too favorable a judgment of them as a whole.&nbsp; Young had
only a very few things to say or sing&mdash;such as that life is
vain, that death is imminent, that man is immortal, that virtue
is wisdom, that friendship is sweet, and that the source of
virtue is the contemplation of death and immortality&mdash;and
even in his two first Nights he had said almost all he had to say
in his finest manner.&nbsp; Through these first outpourings of
&ldquo;complaint&rdquo; we feel that the poet is really sad, that
the bird is singing over a rifled nest; and we bear with his
morbid picture of the world and of life, as the Job-like lament
of a man whom &ldquo;the hand of God hath touched.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Death has carried away his best-beloved, and that &ldquo;silent
land&rdquo; whither they are gone has more reality for the
desolate one than this world which is empty of their love:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the desert, this the solitude;<br
/>
How populous, how vital is the grave!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joy died with the loved one:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
disenchanted earth<br />
Lost all her lustre.&nbsp; Where her glitt&rsquo;ring towers?<br
/>
Her golden mountains, where?&nbsp; All darkened down<br />
To naked waste; a dreary vale of tears:<br />
<i>The great magician&rsquo;s dead</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the pang of parting, it seems to the bereaved man as if
love were only a nerve to suffer with, and he sickens at the
thought of every joy of which he must one day
say&mdash;&ldquo;<i>it </i><!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span><i>was</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In its unreasoning anguish,
the soul rushes to the idea of perpetuity as the one element of
bliss:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O ye blest scenes of permanent
delight!&mdash;<br />
Could ye, so rich in rapture, fear an end,&mdash;<br />
That ghastly thought would drink up all your joy,<br />
And quite unparadise the realms of light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a man under the immediate pressure of a great sorrow, we
tolerate morbid exaggerations; we are prepared to see him turn
away a weary eye from sunlight and flowers and sweet human faces,
as if this rich and glorious life had no significance but as a
preliminary of death; we do not criticise his views, we
compassionate his feelings.&nbsp; And so it is with Young in
these earlier Nights.&nbsp; There is already some artificiality
even in his grief, and feeling often slides into rhetoric, but
through it all we are thrilled with the unmistakable cry of pain,
which makes us tolerant of egoism and hyperbole:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In every varied posture, place, and
hour,<br />
How widow&rsquo;d every thought of every joy!<br />
Thought, busy thought! too busy for my peace!<br />
Through the dark postern of time long elapsed<br />
Led softly, by the stillness of the night,&mdash;<br />
Led like a murderer (and such it proves!)<br />
Strays (wretched rover!) o&rsquo;er the pleasing past,&mdash;<br
/>
In quest of wretchedness, perversely strays;<br />
And finds all desert now; and meets the ghosts<br />
Of my departed joys.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when he becomes didactic, rather than
complaining&mdash;when he ceases to sing his sorrows, and begins
to insist on his opinions&mdash;when that distaste for life which
we pity as a transient feeling is thrust upon us as a theory, we
become perfectly cool and critical, and are not in the least
inclined to be indulgent to false views and selfish
sentiments.</p>
<p>Seeing that we are about to be severe on Young&rsquo;s
failings and failures, we ought, if a reviewer&rsquo;s space were
elastic, to dwell also on his merits&mdash;on the startling vigor
of his imagery&mdash;on the occasional grandeur of his
thought&mdash;on the piquant force of that grave satire into
which his meditations continually run.&nbsp; But, since our
&ldquo;limits&rdquo; are rigorous, we must content ourselves with
the less agreeable half of the critic&rsquo;s duty; and <!-- page
238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>we
may the rather do so, because it would be difficult to say
anything new of Young, in the way of admiration, while we think
there are many salutary lessons remaining to be drawn from his
faults.</p>
<p>One of the most striking characteristics of Young is his
<i>radical insincerity as a poetic artist</i>.&nbsp; This, added
to the thin and artificial texture of his wit, is the true
explanation of the paradox&mdash;that a poet who is often
inopportunely witty has the opposite vice of bombastic
absurdity.&nbsp; The source of all grandiloquence is the want of
taking for a criterion the true qualities of the object described
or the emotion expressed.&nbsp; The grandiloquent man is never
bent on saying what he feels or what he sees, but on producing a
certain effect on his audience; hence he may float away into
utter inanity without meeting any criterion to arrest him.&nbsp;
Here lies the distinction between grandiloquence and genuine
fancy or bold imaginativeness.&nbsp; The fantastic or the boldly
imaginative poet may be as sincere as the most realistic: he is
true to his own sensibilities or inward vision, and in his
wildest flights he never breaks loose from his
criterion&mdash;the truth of his own mental state.&nbsp; Now,
this disruption of language from genuine thought and feeling is
what we are constantly detecting in Young; and his insincerity is
the more likely to betray him into absurdity, because he
habitually treats of abstractions, and not of concrete objects or
specific emotions.&nbsp; He descants perpetually on virtue,
religion, &ldquo;the good man,&rdquo; life, death, immortality,
eternity&mdash;subjects which are apt to give a factitious
grandeur to empty wordiness.&nbsp; When a poet floats in the
empyrean, and only takes a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the earth,
some people accept the mere fact of his soaring for sublimity,
and mistake his dim vision of earth for proximity to
heaven.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His hand the good man fixes on the
skies,<br />
And bids earth roll, nor feels her idle whirl,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may, perhaps, pass for sublime with some readers.&nbsp; But
pause a moment to realize the image, and the monstrous absurdity
of a man&rsquo;s grasping the skies, and hanging habitually
suspended <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>there, while he contemptuously bids
the earth roll, warns you that no genuine feeling could have
suggested so unnatural a conception.&nbsp; Again,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See the man immortal: him, I mean,<br />
Who lives as such; whose heart, full bent on Heaven,<br />
Leans all that way, his bias to the stars.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is worse than the previous example: for you can at least
form some imperfect conception of a man hanging from the skies,
though the position strikes you as uncomfortable and of no
particular use; but you are utterly unable to imagine how his
heart can lean toward the stars.&nbsp; Examples of such vicious
imagery, resulting from insincerity, may be found, perhaps, in
almost every page of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
simple assertions or aspirations, undisguised by imagery, are
often equally false.&nbsp; No writer whose rhetoric was checked
by the slightest truthful intentions could have said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An eye of awe and wonder let me roll,<br />
And roll forever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abstracting the more poetical associations with the eye, this
is hardly less absurd than if he had wished to stand forever with
his mouth open.</p>
<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Far
beneath<br />
A soul immortal is a mortal joy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily for human nature, we are sure no man really believes
that.&nbsp; Which of us has the impiety not to feel that our
souls are only too narrow for the joy of looking into the
trusting eyes of our children, of reposing on the love of a
husband or a wife&mdash;nay, of listening to the divine voice of
music, or watching the calm brightness of autumnal
afternoons?&nbsp; But Young could utter this falsity without
detecting it, because, when he spoke of &ldquo;mortal
joys,&rdquo; he rarely had in his mind any object to which he
could attach sacredness.&nbsp; He was thinking of bishoprics, and
benefices, of smiling monarchs, patronizing prime ministers, and
a &ldquo;much indebted muse.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>Of anything
between these and eternal bliss he was but rarely and moderately
conscious.&nbsp; Often, indeed, he sinks very much below even the
bishopric, and seems to have no notion of earthly pleasure but
such as breathes gaslight and the fumes of wine.&nbsp; His
picture of life is precisely such as you would expect from a man
who has risen from his bed at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon
with a headache and a dim remembrance that he has added to his
&ldquo;debts of honor:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What wretched repetition cloys us here!<br
/>
What periodic potions for the sick,<br />
Distemper&rsquo;d bodies, and distemper&rsquo;d minds?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he flies off to his usual antithesis:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In an eternity what scenes shall strike!<br
/>
Adventures thicken, novelties surprise!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Earth&rdquo; means lords and levees, duchesses and
Dalilahs, South-Sea dreams, and illegal percentage; and the only
things distinctly preferable to these are eternity and the
stars.&nbsp; Deprive Young of this antithesis, and more than half
his eloquence would be shrivelled up.&nbsp; Place him on a breezy
common, where the furze is in its golden bloom, where children
are playing, and horses are standing in the sunshine with
fondling necks, and he would have nothing to say.&nbsp; Here are
neither depths of guilt nor heights of glory; and we doubt
whether in such a scene he would be able to pay his usual
compliment to the Creator:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er I torn, what claim on all
applause!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that he sometimes&mdash;not often&mdash;speaks of
virtue as capable of sweetening life, as well as of taking the
sting from death and winning heaven; and, lest we should be
guilty of any unfairness to him, we will quote the two passages
which convey this sentiment the most explicitly.&nbsp; In the one
he gives &ldquo;Lorenzo&rdquo; this excellent recipe for
obtaining cheerfulness:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go,
fix some weighty truth;<br />
Chain down some passion; do some generous good;<br />
Teach Ignorance to see, or Grief to smile;<br />
<!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>Correct thy friend; befriend thy greatest foe;<br />
Or, with warm heart, and confidence divine,<br />
Spring up, and lay strong hold on Him who made thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other passage is vague, but beautiful, and its music has
murmured in our minds for many years:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
cuckoo seasons sing<br />
The same dull note to such as nothing prize<br />
But what those seasons from the teeming earth<br />
To doting sense indulge.&nbsp; But nobler minds,<br />
Which relish fruit unripened by the sun,<br />
Make their days various; various as the dyes<br />
On the dove&rsquo;s neck, which wanton in his rays.<br />
On minds of dove-like innocence possess&rsquo;d,<br />
On lighten&rsquo;d minds that bask in Virtue&rsquo;s beams,<br />
Nothing hangs tedious, nothing old revolves<br />
In that for which they long, for which they live.<br />
Their glorious efforts, winged with heavenly hopes,<br />
Each rising morning sees still higher rise;<br />
Each bounteous dawn its novelty presents<br />
To worth maturing, new strength, lustre, fame;<br />
While Nature&rsquo;s circle, like a chariot wheel,<br />
Boiling beneath their elevated aims,<br />
Makes their fair prospect fairer every hour;<br />
Advancing virtue in a line to bliss.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even here, where he is in his most amiable mood, you see at
what a telescopic distance he stands from mother Earth and simple
human joys&mdash;&ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s circle rolls
beneath.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, we remember no mind in poetic
literature that seems to have absorbed less of the beauty and the
healthy breath of the common landscape than Young&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
His images, often grand and finely presented&mdash;witness that
sublimely sudden leap of thought,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Embryos we must be till we burst the
shell,<br />
<i>Yon ambient azure shell</i>, and spring to
life&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lie almost entirely within that circle of observation which
would be familiar to a man who lived in town, hung about the
theatres, read the newspaper, and went home often by moon and
starlight.</p>
<p>There is no natural object nearer than the moon that seems to
have any strong attraction for him, and even to the moon he
chiefly appeals for patronage, and &ldquo;pays his court&rdquo;
to her.&nbsp; It is reckoned among the many deficiencies of
&ldquo;Lorenzo&rdquo; <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>that he &ldquo;never asked the moon
one question&rdquo;&mdash;an omission which Young thinks
eminently unbecoming a rational being.&nbsp; He describes nothing
so well as a comet, and is tempted to linger with fond detail
over nothing more familiar than the day of judgment and an
imaginary journey among the stars.&nbsp; Once on Saturn&rsquo;s
ring he feels at home, and his language becomes quite easy:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What
behold I now?<br />
A wilderness of wonders burning round,<br />
Where larger suns inhabit higher spheres;<br />
Perhaps <i>the villas of descending gods</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is like a sudden relief from a strained posture when, in
the &ldquo;Night Thoughts,&rdquo; we come on any allusion that
carries us to the lanes, woods, or fields.&nbsp; Such allusions
are amazingly rare, and we could almost count them on a single
hand.&nbsp; That we may do him no injustice, we will quote the
three best:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like <i>blossom&rsquo;d trees
o&rsquo;erturned by vernal storm</i>,<br />
Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same brook none ever bathed him twice:<br />
To the same life none ever twice awoke.<br />
We call the brook the same&mdash;the same we think<br />
Our life, though still more rapid in its flow;<br />
Nor mark the much irrevocably lapsed<br />
And mingled with the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crown of manhood is a winter joy;<br />
An evergreen that stands the northern blast,<br />
And blossoms in the rigor of our fate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adherence to abstractions, or to the personification of
abstractions, is closely allied in Young to the <i>want of
genuine emotion</i>.&nbsp; He sees virtue sitting on a mount
serene, far above the mists and storms of earth; he sees Religion
coming down from the skies, with this world in her left hand and
the other world in her right; but we never find him dwelling on
virtue or religion as it really exists&mdash;in the emotions of a
man dressed in an ordinary coat, and seated by his fireside of an
evening, with his hand resting on the head of his little
daughter, in courageous effort for unselfish ends, in the <!--
page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>internal triumph of justice and pity over personal
resentment, in all the sublime self-renunciation and sweet
charities which are found in the details of ordinary life.&nbsp;
Now, emotion links itself with particulars, and only in a faint
and secondary manner with abstractions.&nbsp; An orator may
discourse very eloquently on injustice in general, and leave his
audience cold; but let him state a special case of oppression,
and every heart will throb.&nbsp; The most untheoretic persons
are aware of this relation between true emotion and particular
facts, as opposed to general terms, and implicitly recognize it
in the repulsion they feel toward any one who professes strong
feeling about abstractions&mdash;in the interjectional
&ldquo;Humbug!&rdquo; which immediately rises to their
lips.&nbsp; Wherever abstractions appear to excite strong
emotion, this occurs in men of active intellect and imagination,
in whom the abstract term rapidly and vividly calls up the
particulars it represents, these particulars being the true
source of the emotion; and such men, if they wished to express
their feeling, would be infallibly prompted to the presentation
of details.&nbsp; Strong emotion can no more be directed to
generalities apart from particulars, than skill in figures can be
directed to arithmetic apart from numbers.&nbsp; Generalities are
the refuge at once of deficient intellectual activity and
deficient feeling.</p>
<p>If we except the passages in &ldquo;Philander,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Narcissa,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo; there is hardly
a trace of human sympathy, of self-forgetfulness in the joy or
sorrow of a fellow-being, throughout this long poem, which
professes to treat the various phases of man&rsquo;s
destiny.&nbsp; And even in the &ldquo;Narcissa&rdquo; Night,
Young repels us by the low moral tone of his exaggerated
lament.&nbsp; This married step-daughter died at Lyons, and,
being a Protestant, was denied burial, so that her friends had to
bury her in secret&mdash;one of the many miserable results of
superstition, but not a fact to throw an educated, still less a
Christian man, into a fury of hatred and vengeance, in
contemplating it after the lapse of five years.&nbsp; Young,
however, takes great pains to simulate a bad feeling:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--
page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&ldquo;Of grief<br />
And indignation rival bursts I pour&rsquo;d,<br />
Half execration mingled with my pray&rsquo;r;<br />
Kindled at man, while I his God adored;<br />
Sore grudg&rsquo;d the savage land her sacred dust;<br />
Stamp&rsquo;d the cursed soil; <i>and with humanity</i><br />
(<i>Denied Narcissa</i>) <i>wish&rsquo;d them all a
grave</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The odiously bad taste of this last clause makes us hope that
it is simply a platitude, and not intended as witticism, until he
removes the possibility of this favorable doubt by immediately
asking, &ldquo;Flows my resentment into guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, by an afterthought, he attempts something like sympathy,
he only betrays more clearly his want of it.&nbsp; Thus, in the
first Night, when he turns from his private griefs to depict
earth as a hideous abode of misery for all mankind, and asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What then am I, who sorrow for
myself?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he falls at once into calculating the benefit of sorrowing for
others:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More generous sorrow, while it sinks,
exalts;<br />
<i>And conscious virtue mitigates the pang</i>.<br />
Nor virtue, more than prudence, bids me give<br />
Swollen thought a second channel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remarkable negation of sympathy is in perfect consistency
with Young&rsquo;s theory of ethics:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Virtue
is a crime,<br />
A crime of reason, if it costs us pain<br />
Unpaid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is no immortality for man&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sense! take the rein; blind Passion, drive
us on;<br />
And Ignorance! befriend us on our way. . .<br />
Yes; give the pulse full empire; live the Brute,<br />
Since as the brute we die.&nbsp; The sum of man,<br />
Of godlike man, to revel and to rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this life&rsquo;s gain invites him to the deed,<br
/>
Why not his country sold, his father slain?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ambition, avarice, by the wise disdain&rsquo;d,<br />
Is perfect wisdom, while mankind are fools,<br />
And think a turf or tombstone covers all.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>&ldquo;Die for thy country, thou romantic fool!<br />
Seize, seize the plank thyself, and let her sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;As in the dying parent dies the child,<br />
Virtue with Immortality expires.<br />
Who tells me he denies his soul immortal,<br />
<i>Whate&rsquo;er his boost</i>, <i>has told me he&rsquo;s a
knave</i>.<br />
<i>His duty &rsquo;tis to love himself alone</i>.<br />
<i>Nor care though mankind perish if he smiles</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can imagine the man who &ldquo;denies his soul
immortal,&rdquo; replying, &ldquo;It is quite possible that
<i>you</i> would be a knave, and love yourself alone, if it were
not for your belief in immortality; but you are not to force upon
me what would result from your own utter want of moral
emotion.&nbsp; I am just and honest, not because I expect to live
in another world, but because, having felt the pain of injustice
and dishonesty toward myself, I have a fellow-feeling with other
men, who would suffer the same pain if I were unjust or dishonest
toward them.&nbsp; Why should I give my neighbor short weight in
this world, because there is not another world in which I should
have nothing to weigh out to him?&nbsp; I am honest, because I
don&rsquo;t like to inflict evil on others in this life, not
because I&rsquo;m afraid of evil to myself in another.&nbsp; The
fact is, I do <i>not</i> love myself alone, whatever logical
necessity there may be for that in your mind.&nbsp; I have a
tender love for my wife, and children, and friends, and through
that love I sympathize with like affections in other men.&nbsp;
It is a pang to me to witness the sufferings of a fellow-being,
and I feel his suffering the more acutely because he is
<i>mortal</i>&mdash;because his life is so short, and I would
have it, if possible, filled with happiness and not misery.&nbsp;
Through my union and fellowship with the men and women I
<i>have</i> seen, I feel a like, though a fainter, sympathy with
those I have <i>not</i> seen; and I am able so to live in
imagination with the generations to come, that their good is not
alien to me, and is a stimulus to me to labor for ends which may
not benefit myself, but will benefit them.&nbsp; It is possible
that you may prefer to &lsquo;live the brute,&rsquo; to sell your
country, or to slay your father, if you were not afraid of some
disagreeable consequences from <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>the
criminal laws of another world; but even if I could conceive no
motive but my own worldly interest or the gratification of my
animal desire, I have not observed that beastliness, treachery,
and parricide are the direct way to happiness and comfort on
earth.&nbsp; And I should say, that if you feel no motive to
common morality but your fear of a criminal bar in heaven, you
are decidedly a man for the police on earth to keep their eye
upon, since it is matter of world-old experience that fear of
distant consequences is a very insufficient barrier against the
rush of immediate desire.&nbsp; Fear of consequences is only one
form of egoism, which will hardly stand against half a dozen
other forms of egoism bearing down upon it.&nbsp; And in
opposition to your theory that a belief in immortality is the
only source of virtue, I maintain that, so far as moral action is
dependent on that belief, so far the emotion which prompts it is
not truly moral&mdash;is still in the stage of egoism, and has
not yet attained the higher development of sympathy.&nbsp; In
proportion as a man would care less for the rights and welfare of
his fellow, if he did not believe in a future life, in that
proportion is he wanting in the genuine feelings of justice and
benevolence; as the musician who would care less to play a sonata
of Beethoven&rsquo;s finely in solitude than in public, where he
was to be paid for it, is wanting in genuine enthusiasm for
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus far might answer the man who &ldquo;denies himself
immortal;&rdquo; and, allowing for that deficient recognition of
the finer and more indirect influences exercised by the idea of
immortality which might be expected from one who took up a
dogmatic position on such a subject, we think he would have given
a sufficient reply to Young and other theological advocates who,
like him, pique themselves on the loftiness of their doctrine
when they maintain that &ldquo;virtue with immortality
expires.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may admit, indeed, that if the better
part of virtue consists, as Young appears to think, in contempt
for mortal joys, in &ldquo;meditation of our own decease,&rdquo;
and in &ldquo;applause&rdquo; of God in the style of a
congratulatory address to Her Majesty&mdash;all which has small
relation to the well-being of <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>mankind on
this earth&mdash;the motive to it must be gathered from something
that lies quite outside the sphere of human sympathy.&nbsp; But,
for certain other elements of virtue, which are of more obvious
importance to untheological minds&mdash;a delicate sense of our
neighbor&rsquo;s rights, an active participation in the joys and
sorrows of our fellow-men, a magnanimous acceptance of privation
or suffering for ourselves when it is the condition of good to
others, in a word, the extension and intensification of our
sympathetic nature&mdash;we think it of some importance to
contend that they have no more direct relation to the belief in a
future state than the interchange of gases in the lungs has to
the plurality of worlds.&nbsp; Nay, to us it is conceivable that
in some minds the deep pathos lying in the thought of human
mortality&mdash;that we are here for a little while and then
vanish away, that this earthly life is all that is given to our
loved ones and to our many suffering fellow-men&mdash;lies nearer
the fountains of moral emotion than the conception of extended
existence.&nbsp; And surely it ought to be a welcome fact, if the
thought of <i>mortality</i>, as well as of immortality, be
favorable to virtue.&nbsp; Do writers of sermons and religious
novels prefer that men should be vicious in order that there may
be a more evident political and social necessity for printed
sermons and clerical fictions?&nbsp; Because learned gentlemen
are theological, are we to have no more simple honesty and
good-will?&nbsp; We can imagine that the proprietors of a patent
water-supply have a dread of common springs; but, for our own
part, we think there cannot be too great a security against a
lack of fresh water or of pure morality.&nbsp; To us it is a
matter of unmixed rejoicing that this latter necessary of
healthful life is independent of theological ink, and that its
evolution is insured in the interaction of human souls as
certainly as the evolution of science or of art, with which,
indeed, it is but a twin ray, melting into them with undefinable
limits.</p>
<p>To return to Young.&nbsp; We can often detect a man&rsquo;s
deficiencies in what he admires more clearly than in what he
contemns&mdash;in the sentiments he presents as laudable rather
than in those <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>he decries.&nbsp; And in
Young&rsquo;s notion of what is lofty he casts a shadow by which
we can measure him without further trouble.&nbsp; For example, in
arguing for human immortality, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First, what is <i>true ambition</i>?&nbsp;
The pursuit<br />
Of glory <i>nothing less than man can share</i>.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>The Visible and Present are for brutes,<br />
A slender portion, and a narrow bound!<br />
These Reason, with an energy divine,<br />
O&rsquo;erleaps, and claims the Future and Unseen;<br />
The vast Unseen, the Future fathomless!<br />
When the great soul buoys up to this high point,<br />
Leaving gross Nature&rsquo;s sediments below,<br />
Then, and then only, Adam&rsquo;s offspring quits<br />
The sage and hero of the fields and woods,<br />
Asserts his rank, and rises into man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then, if it were certified that, as some benevolent minds
have tried to infer, our dumb fellow-creatures would share a
future existence, in which it is to be hoped we should neither
beat, starve, nor maim them, our ambition for a future life would
cease to be &ldquo;lofty!&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a notion of
loftiness which may pair off with Dr. Whewell&rsquo;s celebrated
observation, that Bentham&rsquo;s moral theory is low because it
includes justice and mercy to brutes.</p>
<p>But, for a reflection of Young&rsquo;s moral personality on a
colossal scale, we must turn to those passages where his rhetoric
is at its utmost stretch of inflation&mdash;where he addresses
the Deity, discourses of the Divine operations, or describes the
last judgment.&nbsp; As a compound of vulgar pomp, crawling
adulation, and hard selfishness, presented under the guise of
piety, there are few things in literature to surpass the Ninth
Night, entitled &ldquo;Consolation,&rdquo; especially in the
pages where he describes the last judgment&mdash;a subject to
which, with na&iuml;ve self-betrayal, he applies phraseology,
favored by the exuberant penny-a-liner.&nbsp; Thus, when God
descends, and the groans of hell are opposed by &ldquo;shouts of
joy,&rdquo; much as cheers and groans contend at a public meeting
where the resolutions are <i>not</i> passed unanimously, the poet
completes his climax in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>&ldquo;Hence, in one peal of loud,
eternal praise,<br />
The <i>charmed spectators</i> thunder their applause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same taste he sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Eternity, the various sentence past,<br />
Assigns the sever&rsquo;d throng distinct abodes,<br />
<i>Sulphureous</i> or <i>ambrosial</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exquisite delicacy of indication!&nbsp; He is too nice to be
specific as to the interior of the &ldquo;sulphureous&rdquo;
abode; but when once half the human race are shut up there, hear
how he enjoys turning the key on them!</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What
ensues?<br />
The deed predominant, the deed of deeds!<br />
Which makes a hell of hell, a <i>heaven of heaven</i>!<br />
The goddess, with determin&rsquo;d aspect turns<br />
Her adamantine key&rsquo;s enormous size<br />
Through Destiny&rsquo;s inextricable wards,<br />
<i>Deep driving every bolt</i> on both their fates.<br />
Then, from the crystal battlements of heaven,<br />
Down, down she hurls it through the dark profound,<br />
Ten thousand, thousand fathom; there to rust<br />
And ne&rsquo;er unlock her resolution more.<br />
The deep resounds; and Hell, through all her glooms,<br />
Returns, in groans, the melancholy roar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the blessings for which Dr. Young thanks God
&ldquo;most:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For all I bless thee,
most, for the severe;<br />
Her death&mdash;my own at hand&mdash;<i>the fiery gulf</i>,<br />
<i>That flaming bound of wrath omnipotent</i>!<br />
<i>It thunders</i>;&mdash;<i>but it thunders to preserve</i>;<br
/>
. . . its wholesome dread<br />
Averts the dreaded pain; <i>its hideous groans</i><br />
<i>Join Heaven&rsquo;s sweet Hallelujahs in Thy praise</i>,<br />
Great Source of good alone!&nbsp; How kind in all!<br />
In vengeance kind!&nbsp; Pain, Death, Gehenna, <i>save</i>&rdquo;
. . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>i.e.</i>, save <i>me</i>, Dr. Young, who, in return for
that favor, promise to give my divine patron the monopoly of that
exuberance in laudatory epithet, of which specimens may be seen
at any moment in a large number of dedications and odes to kings,
queens, prime ministers, and other persons of distinction.&nbsp;
<i>That</i>, in Young&rsquo;s conception, is what God delights
in.&nbsp; His crowning aim in the &ldquo;drama&rdquo; of the
ages, is to vindicate his own renown.&nbsp; The God of the
&ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>is simply
Young himself &ldquo;writ large&rdquo;&mdash;a didactic poet, who
&ldquo;lectures&rdquo; mankind in the antithetic hyperbole of
mortal and immortal joys, earth and the stars, hell and heaven;
and expects the tribute of inexhaustible
&ldquo;applause.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young has no conception of religion
as anything else than egoism turned heavenward; and he does not
merely imply this, he insists on it.&nbsp; Religion, he tells us,
in argumentative passages too long to quote, is &ldquo;ambition,
pleasure, and the love of gain,&rdquo; directed toward the joys
of the future life instead of the present.&nbsp; And his ethics
correspond to his religion.&nbsp; He vacillates, indeed, in his
ethical theory, and shifts his position in order to suit his
immediate purpose in argument; but he never changes his level so
as to see beyond the horizon of mere selfishness.&nbsp; Sometimes
he insists, as we have seen, that the belief in a future life is
the only basis of morality; but elsewhere he tells us&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In self-applause is virtue&rsquo;s golden
prize.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtue, with Young, must always squint&mdash;must never look
straight toward the immediate object of its emotion and
effort.&nbsp; Thus, if a man risks perishing in the snow himself
rather than forsake a weaker comrade, he must either do this
because his hopes and fears are directed to another world, or
because he desires to applaud himself afterward!&nbsp; Young, if
we may believe him, would despise the action as folly unless it
had these motives.&nbsp; Let us hope he was not so bad as he
pretended to be!&nbsp; The tides of the divine life in man move
under the thickest ice of theory.</p>
<p>Another indication of Young&rsquo;s deficiency in moral,
<i>i.e.</i>, in sympathetic emotion, is his unintermitting habit
of pedagogic moralizing.&nbsp; On its theoretic and perceptive
side, morality touches science; on its emotional side, Art.&nbsp;
Now, the products of Art are great in proportion as they result
from that immediate prompting of innate power which we call
Genius, and not from labored obedience to a theory or rule; and
the presence of genius or innate prompting is directly opposed to
the perpetual consciousness of a rule.&nbsp; The action of
faculty is <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>imperious, and excludes the
reflection <i>why</i> it should act.&nbsp; In the same way, in
proportion as morality is emotional, <i>i.e.</i>, has affinity
with Art, it will exhibit itself in direct sympathetic feeling
and action, and not as the recognition of a rule.&nbsp; Love does
not say, &ldquo;I ought to love&rdquo;&mdash;it loves.&nbsp; Pity
does not say, &ldquo;It is right to be pitiful&rdquo;&mdash;it
pities.&nbsp; Justice does not say, &ldquo;I am bound to be
just&rdquo;&mdash;it feels justly.&nbsp; It is only where moral
emotion is comparatively weak that the contemplation of a rule or
theory habitually mingles with its action; and in accordance with
this, we think experience, both in literature and life, has shown
that the minds which are pre-eminently didactic&mdash;which
insist on a &ldquo;lesson,&rdquo; and despise everything that
will not convey a moral, are deficient in sympathetic
emotion.&nbsp; A certain poet is recorded to have said that he
&ldquo;wished everything of his burned that did not impress some
moral; even in love-verses, it might be flung in by the
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; What poet was it who took this medicinal view
of poetry?&nbsp; Dr. Watts, or James Montgomery, or some other
singer of spotless life and ardent piety?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp;
It was <i>Waller</i>.&nbsp; A significant fact in relation to our
position, that the predominant didactic tendency proceeds rather
from the poet&rsquo;s perception that it is good for other men to
be moral, than from any overflow of moral feeling in
himself.&nbsp; A man who is perpetually thinking in apothegms,
who has an unintermittent flux of admonition, can have little
energy left for simple emotion.&nbsp; And this is the case with
Young.&nbsp; In his highest flights of contemplation and his most
wailing soliloquies he interrupts himself to fling an admonitory
parenthesis at &ldquo;Lorenzo,&rdquo; or to hint that
&ldquo;folly&rsquo;s creed&rdquo; is the reverse of his
own.&nbsp; Before his thoughts can flow, he must fix his eye on
an imaginary miscreant, who gives unlimited scope for lecturing,
and recriminates just enough to keep the spring of admonition and
argument going to the extent of nine books.&nbsp; It is curious
to see how this pedagogic habit of mind runs through
Young&rsquo;s contemplation of Nature.&nbsp; As the tendency to
see our own sadness reflected in the external world has been
called by Mr. Ruskin the &ldquo;pathetic fallacy,&rdquo; <!--
page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>so we may call Young&rsquo;s disposition to see a
rebuke or a warning in every natural object, the &ldquo;pedagogic
fallacy.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his mind, the heavens are &ldquo;forever
<i>scolding</i> as they shine;&rdquo; and the great function of
the stars is to be a &ldquo;lecture to mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
conception of the Deity as a didactic author is not merely an
implicit point of view with him; he works it out in elaborate
imagery, and at length makes it the occasion of his most
extraordinary achievement in the &ldquo;art of sinking,&rdquo; by
exclaiming, <i>&agrave; propos</i>, we need hardly say, of the
nocturnal heavens,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Divine Instructor!&nbsp; Thy first volume
this<br />
For man&rsquo;s perusal! all in <span
class="smcap">capitals</span>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this pedagogic tendency, this sermonizing attitude of
Young&rsquo;s mind, which produces the wearisome monotony of his
pauses.&nbsp; After the first two or three nights he is rarely
singing, rarely pouring forth any continuous melody inspired by
the spontaneous flow of thought or feeling.&nbsp; He is rather
occupied with argumentative insistence, with hammering in the
proofs of his propositions by disconnected verses, which he puts
down at intervals.&nbsp; The perpetual recurrence of the pause at
the end of the line throughout long passages makes them as
fatiguing to the ear as a monotonous chant, which consists of the
endless repetition of one short musical phrase.&nbsp; For
example:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Past
hours,<br />
If not by guilt, yet wound us by their flight,<br />
If folly bound our prospect by the grave,<br />
All feeling of futurity be numb&rsquo;d,<br />
All godlike passion for eternals quench&rsquo;d,<br />
All relish of realities expired;<br />
Renounced all correspondence with the skies;<br />
Our freedom chain&rsquo;d; quite wingless our desire;<br />
In sense dark-prison&rsquo;d all that ought to soar;<br />
Prone to the centre; crawling in the dust;<br />
Dismounted every great and glorious aim;<br />
Enthralled every faculty divine,<br />
Heart-buried in the rubbish of the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How different from the easy, graceful melody of Cowper&rsquo;s
blank verse!&nbsp; Indeed, it is hardly possible to criticise
Young without being reminded at every step of the contrast
presented <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>to him by Cowper.&nbsp; And this
contrast urges itself upon us the more from the fact that there
is, to a certain extent, a parallelism between the &ldquo;Night
Thoughts&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Task.&rdquo;&nbsp; In both poems
the author achieves his greatest in virtue of the new freedom
conferred by blank verse; both poems are professionally didactic,
and mingle much satire with their graver meditations; both poems
are the productions of men whose estimate of this life was formed
by the light of a belief in immortality, and who were intensely
attached to Christianity.&nbsp; On some grounds we might have
anticipated a more morbid view of things from Cowper than from
Young.&nbsp; Cowper&rsquo;s religion was dogmatically the more
gloomy, for he was a Calvinist; while Young was a
&ldquo;low&rdquo; Arminian, believing that Christ died for all,
and that the only obstacle to any man&rsquo;s salvation lay in
his will, which he could change if he chose.&nbsp; There was real
and deep sadness involved in Cowper&rsquo;s personal lot; while
Young, apart from his ambitious and greedy discontent, seems to
have had no great sorrow.</p>
<p>Yet, see how a lovely, sympathetic nature manifests itself in
spite of creed and circumstance!&nbsp; Where is the poem that
surpasses the &ldquo;Task&rdquo; in the genuine love it breathes,
at once toward inanimate and animate existence&mdash;in
truthfulness of perception and sincerity of presentation&mdash;in
the calm gladness that springs from a delight in objects for
their own sake, without self-reference&mdash;in divine sympathy
with the lowliest pleasures, with the most short-lived capacity
for pain?&nbsp; Here is no railing at the earth&rsquo;s
&ldquo;melancholy map,&rdquo; but the happiest lingering over her
simplest scenes with all the fond minuteness of attention that
belongs to love; no pompous rhetoric about the inferiority of the
&ldquo;brutes,&rdquo; but a warm plea on their behalf against
man&rsquo;s inconsiderateness and cruelty, and a sense of
enlarged happiness from their companionship in enjoyment; no
vague rant about human misery and human virtue, but that close
and vivid presentation of particular sorrows and privations, of
particular deeds and misdeeds, which is the direct road to the
emotions.&nbsp; How Cowper&rsquo;s exquisite mind falls <!-- page
254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>with the mild warmth of morning sunlight on the
commonest objects, at once disclosing every detail, and investing
every detail with beauty!&nbsp; No object is too small to prompt
his song&mdash;not the sooty film on the bars, or the spoutless
teapot holding a bit of mignonette that serves to cheer the dingy
town-lodging with a &ldquo;hint that Nature lives;&rdquo; and yet
his song is never trivial, for he is alive to small objects, not
because his mind is narrow, but because his glance is clear and
his heart is large.&nbsp; Instead of trying to edify us by
supercilious allusions to the &ldquo;brutes&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;stalls,&rdquo; he interests us in that tragedy of the
hen-roost when the thief has wrenched the door,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where Chanticleer amidst his harem
sleeps<br />
<i>In unsuspecting pomp</i>;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the patient cattle, that on the winter&rsquo;s morning</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mourn in corners where
the fence<br />
Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep<br />
<i>In unrecumbent sadness</i>;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the little squirrel, that, surprised by him in his woodland
walk,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At
once, swift as a bird,<br />
Ascends the neighboring beech; there whisks his brush,<br />
And perks his ears, and stamps, and cries aloud,<br />
With all the prettiness of feign&rsquo;d alarm<br />
And anger insignificantly fierce.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he passes into reflection, not with curt apothegm and
snappish reproof, but with that melodious flow of utterance which
belongs to thought when it is carried along in a stream of
feeling:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The heart is hard in nature, and unfit<br
/>
For human fellowship, as being void<br />
Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike<br />
To love and friendship both, that is not pleased<br />
With sight of animals enjoying life,<br />
Nor feels their happiness augment his own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His large and tender heart embraces the most every-day forms
of human life&mdash;the carter driving his team through the
wintry storm; the cottager&rsquo;s wife who, painfully nursing
the embers on her hearth, while her infants &ldquo;sit cowering
o&rsquo;er the sparks,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Retires, content to quake, so they be
warm&rsquo;d;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or the villager, with her little ones, going out to pick</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A cheap but wholesome salad from the
brook;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>and he compels our colder natures to follow his in its
manifold sympathies, not by exhortations, not by telling us to
meditate at midnight, to &ldquo;indulge&rdquo; the thought of
death, or to ask ourselves how we shall &ldquo;weather an eternal
night,&rdquo; <i>but by presenting to us the object of his
compassion truthfully and lovingly</i>.&nbsp; And when he handles
greater themes, when he takes a wider survey, and considers the
men or the deeds which have a direct influence on the welfare of
communities and nations, there is the same unselfish warmth of
feeling, the same scrupulous truthfulness.&nbsp; He is never
vague in his remonstrance or his satire, but puts his finger on
some particular vice or folly which excites his indignation or
&ldquo;dissolves his heart in pity,&rdquo; because of some
specific injury it does to his fellow-man or to a sacred
cause.&nbsp; And when he is asked why he interests himself about
the sorrows and wrongs of others, hear what is the reason he
gives.&nbsp; Not, like Young, that the movements of the planets
show a mutual dependence, and that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus man his sovereign duty learns in
this<br />
Material picture of benevolence,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More generous sorrow, while it sinks,
exalts,<br />
And conscious virtue mitigates the pang.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is Cowper&rsquo;s answer, when he imagines some
&ldquo;sage, erudite, profound,&rdquo; asking him
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the world to you?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Much.&nbsp; <i>I was born of woman</i>,
<i>and drew milk</i><br />
<i>As sweet as charity from human breasts</i>.<br />
I think, articulate, I laugh and weep,<br />
And exercise all functions of a man.<br />
How then should I and any man that lives<br />
Be strangers to each other?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young is astonished that men can make war on each
other&mdash;that any one can &ldquo;seize his brother&rsquo;s
throat,&rdquo; while</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Planets cry,
&lsquo;Forbear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowper weeps because</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no flesh in man&rsquo;s obdurate
heart:<br />
<i>It does not feel for man</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young applauds God as a monarch with an empire and a court
quite superior to the English, or as an author who produces
&ldquo;volumes for man&rsquo;s perusal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cowper sees
his father&rsquo;s love in all the gentle pleasures of the home
fireside, in the charms even of the wintry landscape, and
thinks&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>&ldquo;Happy who walks with him!
whom what he finds<br />
Of flavor or of scent in fruit or flower,<br />
Or what he views of beautiful or grand<br />
In nature, from the broad, majestic oak<br />
To the green blade that twinkles in the sun,<br />
<i>Prompts with remembrance of a present God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To conclude&mdash;for we must arrest ourselves in a contrast
that would lead us beyond our bounds.&nbsp; Young flies for his
utmost consolation to the day of judgment, when</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Final
Ruin fiercely drives<br />
Her ploughshare o&rsquo;er creation;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when earth, stars, and sun are swept aside,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And now, all dross removed, Heaven&rsquo;s
own pure day,<br />
Full on the confines of our ether, flames:<br />
While (dreadful contrast!) far (how far!) beneath,<br />
Hell, bursting, belches forth her blazing seas,<br />
And storms suphureous; her voracious jaws<br />
Expanding wide, and roaring for her prey,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Young and similar &ldquo;ornaments of religion and
virtue&rdquo; passing of course with grateful
&ldquo;applause&rdquo; into the upper region.&nbsp; Cowper finds
his highest inspiration in the Millennium&mdash;in the
restoration of this our beloved home of earth to perfect holiness
and bliss, when the Supreme</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shall visit earth in mercy; shall
descend<br />
Propitious in his chariot paved with love;<br />
And what his storms have blasted and defaced<br />
For man&rsquo;s revolt, shall with a smile repair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And into what delicious melody his song flows at the thought
of that blessedness to be enjoyed by future generations on
earth!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dwellers in the vales and on the
rocks<br />
Shout to each other, and the mountains tops<br />
From distant mountains catch the flying joy;<br />
Till, nation after nation taught the strain,<br />
Earth rolls the rapturous Hosanna round!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sum of our comparison is this: In Young we have the type
of that deficient human sympathy, that impiety toward the present
and the visible, which flies for its motives, its sanctities, and
its religion, to the remote, the vague, and the unknown: in
Cowper we have the type of that genuine love which cherishes
things in proportion to their nearness, and feels its reverence
grow in proportion to the intimacy of its knowledge.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 257</span>VIII.&nbsp; THE INFLUENCE OF
RATIONALISM. <a name="citation257"></a><a href="#footnote257"
class="citation">[257]</a></h3>
<p>There is a valuable class of books on great subjects which
have something of the character and functions of good popular
lecturing.&nbsp; They are not original, not subtle, not of close
logical texture, not exquisite either in thought or style; but by
virtue of these negatives they are all the more fit to act on the
average intelligence.&nbsp; They have enough of organizing
purpose in them to make their facts illustrative, and to leave a
distinct result in the mind even when most of the facts are
forgotten; and they have enough of vagueness and vacillation in
their theory to win them ready acceptance from a mixed
audience.&nbsp; The vagueness and vacillation are not devices of
timidity; they are the honest result of the writer&rsquo;s own
mental character, which adapts him to be the instructor and the
favorite of &ldquo;the general reader.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the most
part, the general reader of the present day does not exactly know
what distance he goes; he only knows that he does not go
&ldquo;too far.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of any remarkable thinker, whose
writings have excited controversy, he likes to have it said that
&ldquo;his errors are to be deplored,&rdquo; leaving it not too
certain what those errors are; he is fond of what may be called
disembodied opinions, that float in vapory phrases above all
systems of thought or action; he likes an undefined Christianity
which opposes itself to nothing in particular, an undefined
education of the people, an undefined amelioration of all things:
in fact, he likes sound views&mdash;nothing extreme, but
something between the excesses of the past and the excesses of
the present.&nbsp; This modern type of the general reader may be
known in conversation by the cordiality with which he assents to
indistinct, blurred statements: say that black is black, he will
shake his head and hardly think it; say that black is not so very
black, he will reply, &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>He
has no hesitation, if you wish it, even to get up at a public
meeting and express his conviction that at times, and within
certain limits, the radii of a circle have a tendency to be
equal; but, on the other hand, he would urge that the spirit of
geometry may be carried a little too far.&nbsp; His only bigotry
is a bigotry against any clearly defined opinion; not in the
least based on a scientific scepticism, but belonging to a lack
of coherent thought&mdash;a spongy texture of mind, that
gravitates strongly to nothing.&nbsp; The one thing he is staunch
for is, the utmost liberty of private haziness.</p>
<p>But precisely these characteristics of the general reader,
rendering him incapable of assimilating ideas unless they are
administered in a highly diluted form, make it a matter of
rejoicing that there are clever, fair-minded men, who will write
books for him&mdash;men very much above him in knowledge and
ability, but not too remote from him in their habits of thinking,
and who can thus prepare for him infusions of history and science
that will leave some solidifying deposit, and save him from a
fatal softening of the intellectual skeleton.&nbsp; Among such
serviceable writers, Mr. Lecky&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the Rise
and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe&rdquo;
entitles him to a high place.&nbsp; He has prepared himself for
its production by an unusual amount of well-directed reading; he
has chosen his facts and quotations with much judgment; and he
gives proof of those important moral qualifications,
impartiality, seriousness, and modesty.&nbsp; This praise is
chiefly applicable to the long chapter on the history of Magic
and Witchcraft, which opens the work, and to the two chapters on
the antecedents and history of Persecution, which occur, the one
at the end of the first volume, the other at the beginning of the
second.&nbsp; In these chapters Mr. Lecky has a narrower and
better-traced path before him than in other portions of his work;
he is more occupied with presenting a particular class of facts
in their historical sequence, and in their relation to certain
grand tide-marks of opinion, than with disquisition; and his
writing is freer than elsewhere from an apparent confusedness of
thought and an exuberance of approximative phrases, which can be
serviceable in no other way than as diluents needful for the sort
of reader we have just described.</p>
<p>The history of magic and witchcraft has been judiciously
chosen by Mr. Lecky as the subject of his first section on the
Declining Sense of the Miraculous, because it is strikingly
illustrative of a position with the truth of which he is strongly
<!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>impressed, though he does not always treat of it with
desirable clearness and precision, namely, that certain beliefs
become obsolete, not in consequence of direct arguments against
them, but because of their incongruity with prevalent habits of
thought.&nbsp; Here is his statement of the two &ldquo;classes of
influences&rdquo; by which the mass of men, in what is called
civilized society, get their beliefs gradually modified:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If we ask why it is that the world has
rejected what was once so universally and so intensely believed,
why a narrative of an old woman who had been seen riding on a
broomstick, or who was proved to have transformed herself into a
wolf, and to have devoured the flocks of her neighbors, is deemed
so entirely incredible, most persons would probably be unable to
give a very definite answer to the question.&nbsp; It is not
because we have examined the evidence and found it insufficient,
for the disbelief always precedes, when it does not prevent,
examination.&nbsp; It is rather because the idea of absurdity is
so strongly attached to such narratives, that it is difficult
even to consider them with gravity.&nbsp; Yet at one time no such
improbability was felt, and hundreds of persons have been burnt
simply on the two grounds I have mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When so complete a change takes place in public
opinion, it may be ascribed to one or other of two causes.&nbsp;
It may be the result of a controversy which has conclusively
settled the question, establishing to the satisfaction of all
parties a clear preponderance of argument or fact in favor of one
opinion, and making that opinion a truism which is accepted by
all enlightened men, even though they have not themselves
examined the evidence on which it rests.&nbsp; Thus, if any one
in a company of ordinarily educated persons were to deny the
motion of the earth, or the circulation of the blood, his
statement would be received with derision, though it is probable
that some of his audience would be unable to demonstrate the
first truth, and that very few of them could give sufficient
reasons for the second.&nbsp; They may not themselves be able to
defend their position; but they are aware that, at certain known
periods of history, controversies on those subjects took place,
and that known writers then brought forward some definite
arguments or experiments, which were ultimately accepted by the
whole learned world as rigid and conclusive demonstrations.&nbsp;
It is possible, also, for as complete a change to be effected by
what is called the spirit of the age.&nbsp; The general
intellectual tendencies pervading the literature of a century
profoundly modify the character of the public mind.&nbsp; They
form a new tone and habit of thought.&nbsp; They alter the
measure of probability.&nbsp; They create new attractions and new
antipathies, and they eventually cause as absolute a rejection of
certain old opinions as could be produced by the most cogent and
definite arguments.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Lecky proceeds to some questionable views concerning the
evidences of witchcraft, which seem to be irreconcilable even
with his own remarks later on; but they lead him to the <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>statement, thoroughly made out by his historical
survey, that &ldquo;movement was mainly silent, unargumentative,
and insensible; that men came gradually to disbelieve in
witchcraft, because they came gradually to look upon it as
absurd; and that this new tone of thought appeared, first of all,
in those who were least subject to theological influences, and
soon spread through the educated laity, and, last of all, took
possession of the clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have rather painful proof that this &ldquo;second class of
influences,&rdquo; with a vast number go hardly deeper than
Fashion, and that witchcraft to many of us is absurd only on the
same ground that our grandfathers&rsquo; gigs are absurd.&nbsp;
It is felt preposterous to think of spiritual agencies in
connection with ragged beldames soaring on broomsticks, in an age
when it is known that mediums of communication with the invisible
world are usually unctuous personages dressed in excellent
broadcloth, who soar above the curtain-poles without any
broomstick, and who are not given to unprofitable
intrigues.&nbsp; The enlightened imagination rejects the figure
of a witch with her profile in dark relief against the moon and
her broomstick cutting a constellation.&nbsp; No undiscovered
natural laws, no names of &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; witnesses,
are invoked to make us feel our presumption in questioning the
diabolic intimacies of that obsolete old woman, for it is known
now that the undiscovered laws, and the witnesses qualified by
the payment of income tax, are all in favor of a different
conception&mdash;the image of a heavy gentleman in boots and
black coat-tails foreshortened against the cornice.&nbsp; Yet no
less a person than Sir Thomas Browne once wrote that those who
denied there were witches, inasmuch as they thereby denied
spirits also, were &ldquo;obliquely and upon consequence a sort,
not of infidels, but of atheists.&rdquo;&nbsp; At present,
doubtless, in certain circles, unbelievers in heavy gentlemen who
float in the air by means of undiscovered laws are also taxed
with atheism; illiberal as it is not to admit that mere weakness
of understanding may prevent one from seeing how that phenomenon
is necessarily involved in the Divine origin of things.&nbsp;
With still more remarkable parallelism, Sir Thomas Browne goes
on: &ldquo;Those that, to refute their incredulity, desire to see
apparitions, shall questionless never behold any, nor have the
power to be so much as witches.&nbsp; The devil hath made them
already in a heresy as capital as witchcraft, <i>and to appear to
them were but to convert them</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be
difficult to see what has been changed here, but the <!-- page
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>mere drapery of circumstance, if it were not for this
prominent difference between our own days and the days of
witchcraft, that instead of torturing, drowning, or burning the
innocent, we give hospitality and large pay to&mdash;the highly
distinguished medium.&nbsp; At least we are safely rid of certain
horrors; but if the multitude&mdash;that &ldquo;farraginous
concurrence of all conditions, tempers, sexes, and
ages&rdquo;&mdash;do not roll back even to a superstition that
carries cruelty in its train, it is not because they possess a
cultivated reason, but because they are pressed upon and held up
by what we may call an external reason&mdash;the sum of
conditions resulting from the laws of material growth, from
changes produced by great historical collisions shattering the
structures of ages and making new highways for events and ideas,
and from the activities of higher minds no longer existing merely
as opinions and teaching, but as institutions and organizations
with which the interests, the affections, and the habits of the
multitude are inextricably interwoven.&nbsp; No undiscovered laws
accounting for small phenomena going forward under drawing-room
tables are likely to affect the tremendous facts of the increase
of population, the rejection of convicts by our colonies, the
exhaustion of the soil by cotton plantations, which urge even
upon the foolish certain questions, certain claims, certain views
concerning the scheme of the world, that can never again be
silenced.&nbsp; If right reason is a right representation of the
co-existence and sequences of things, here are co-existences and
sequences that do not wait to be discovered, but press themselves
upon us like bars of iron.&nbsp; No s&eacute;ances at a guinea a
head for the sake of being pinched by &ldquo;Mary Jane&rdquo; can
annihilate railways, steamships, and electric telegraphs, which
are demonstrating the interdependence of all human interests, and
making self-interest a duct for sympathy.&nbsp; These things are
part of the external Reason to which internal silliness has
inevitably to accommodate itself.</p>
<p>Three points in the history of magic and witchcraft are well
brought out by Mr. Lecky.&nbsp; First, that the cruelties
connected with it did not begin until men&rsquo;s minds had
ceased to repose implicitly in a sacramental system which made
them feel well armed against evil spirits; that is, until the
eleventh century, when there came a sort of morning dream of
doubt and heresy, bringing on the one side the terror of timid
consciences, and on the other the terrorism of authority or zeal
bent on checking the rising struggle.&nbsp; In that time of
comparative mental repose, says Mr. Lecky,</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>&ldquo;All those conceptions of
diabolical presence; all that predisposition toward the
miraculous, which acted so fearfully upon the imaginations of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, existed; but the implicit
faith, the boundless and triumphant credulity with which the
virtue of ecclesiastical rites was accepted, rendered them
comparatively innocuous.&nbsp; If men had been a little less
superstitious, the effects of their superstition would have been
much more terrible.&nbsp; It was firmly believed that any one who
deviated from the strict line of orthodoxy must soon succumb
beneath the power of Satan; but as there was no spirit of
rebellion or doubt, this persuasion did not produce any
extraordinary terrorism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church was disposed to confound heretical opinion with
sorcery; false doctrine was especially the devil&rsquo;s work,
and it was a ready conclusion that a denier or innovator had held
consultation with the father of lies.&nbsp; It is a saying of a
zealous Catholic in the sixteenth century, quoted by Maury in his
excellent work, &ldquo;De la Magie&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Crescit
cum magia h&aelig;resis</i>, <i>cum h&aelig;resi
magia</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even those who doubted were terrified at
their doubts, for trust is more easily undermined than
terror.&nbsp; Fear is earlier born than hope, lays a stronger
grasp on man&rsquo;s system than any other passion, and remains
master of a larger group of involuntary actions.&nbsp; A chief
aspect of man&rsquo;s moral development is the slow subduing of
fear by the gradual growth of intelligence, and its suppression
as a motive by the presence of impulses less animally selfish; so
that in relation to invisible Power, fear at last ceases to
exist, save in that interfusion with higher faculties which we
call awe.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Lecky shows clearly that dogmatic Protestantism,
holding the vivid belief in Satanic agency to be an essential of
piety, would have felt it shame to be a whit behind Catholicism
in severity against the devil&rsquo;s servants.&nbsp;
Luther&rsquo;s sentiment was that he would not suffer a witch to
live (he was not much more merciful to Jews); and, in spite of
his fondness for children, believing a certain child to have been
begotten by the devil, he recommended the parents to throw it
into the river.&nbsp; The torch must be turned on the worst
errors of heroic minds&mdash;not in irreverent ingratitude, but
for the sake of measuring our vast and various debt to all the
influences which have concurred, in the intervening ages, to make
us recognize as detestable errors the honest convictions of men
who, in mere individual capacity and moral force, were very much
above us.&nbsp; Again, the Scotch Puritans, during the
comparatively short period of their ascendency, surpassed all
Christians before them in the elaborate ingenuity of the <!--
page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>tortures they applied for the discovery of witchcraft
and sorcery, and did their utmost to prove that if Scotch
Calvinism was the true religion, the chief &ldquo;note&rdquo; of
the true religion was cruelty.&nbsp; It is hardly an endurable
task to read the story of their doings; thoroughly to imagine
them as a past reality is already a sort of torture.&nbsp; One
detail is enough, and it is a comparatively mild one.&nbsp; It
was the regular profession of men called &ldquo;prickers&rdquo;
to thrust long pins into the body of a suspected witch in order
to detect the insensible spot which was the infallible sign of
her guilt.&nbsp; On a superficial view one would be in danger of
saying that the main difference between the teachers who
sanctioned these things and the much-despised ancestors who
offered human victims inside a huge wicker idol, was that they
arrived at a more elaborate barbarity by a longer series of
dependent propositions.&nbsp; We do not share Mr. Buckle&rsquo;s
opinion that a Scotch minister&rsquo;s groans were a part of his
deliberate plan for keeping the people in a state of terrified
subjection; the ministers themselves held the belief they taught,
and might well groan over it.&nbsp; What a blessing has a little
false logic been to the world!&nbsp; Seeing that men are so slow
to question their premises, they must have made each other much
more miserable, if pity had not sometimes drawn tender
conclusions not warranted by Major and Minor; if there had not
been people with an amiable imbecility of reasoning which enabled
them at once to cling to hideous beliefs, and to be
conscientiously inconsistent with them in their conduct.&nbsp;
There is nothing like acute deductive reasoning for keeping a man
in the dark: it might be called the <i>technique</i> of the
intellect, and the concentration of the mind upon it corresponds
to that predominance of technical skill in art which ends in
degradation of the artist&rsquo;s function, unless new
inspiration and invention come to guide it.</p>
<p>And of this there is some good illustration furnished by that
third node in the history of witchcraft, the beginning of its
end, which is treated in an interesting manner by Mr.
Lecky.&nbsp; It is worth noticing, that the most important
defences of the belief in witchcraft, against the growing
scepticism in the latter part of the sixteenth century and in the
seventeenth, were the productions of men who in some departments
were among the foremost thinkers of their time.&nbsp; One of them
was Jean Bodin, the famous writer on government and
jurisprudence, whose &ldquo;Republic,&rdquo; Hallam thinks, had
an important influence in England, and furnished &ldquo;a store
of arguments and examples <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>that were
not lost on the thoughtful minds of our countrymen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In some of his views he was original and bold; for example, he
anticipated Montesquieu in attempting to appreciate the relations
of government and climate.&nbsp; Hallam inclines to the opinion
that he was a Jew, and attached Divine authority only to the Old
Testament.&nbsp; But this was enough to furnish him with his
chief data for the existence of witches and for their capital
punishment; and in the account of his &ldquo;Republic,&rdquo;
given by Hallam, there is enough evidence that the sagacity which
often enabled him to make fine use of his learning was also often
entangled in it, to temper our surprise at finding a writer on
political science of whom it could be said that, along with
Montesquieu, he was &ldquo;the most philosophical of those who
had read so deeply, the most learned of those who had thought so
much,&rdquo; in the van of the forlorn hope to maintain the
reality of witchcraft.&nbsp; It should be said that he was
equally confident of the unreality of the Copernican hypothesis,
on the ground that it was contrary to the tenets of the
theologians and philosophers and to common-sense, and therefore
subversive of the foundations of every science.&nbsp; Of his work
on witchcraft, Mr. Lecky says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;D&eacute;monomanie des
Sorciers&rsquo; is chiefly an appeal to authority, which the
author deemed on this subject so unanimous and so conclusive,
that it was scarcely possible for any sane man to resist
it.&nbsp; He appealed to the popular belief in all countries, in
all ages, and in all religions.&nbsp; He cited the opinions of an
immense multitude of the greatest writers of pagan antiquity, and
of the most illustrious of the Fathers.&nbsp; He showed how the
laws of all nations recognized the existence of witchcraft; and
he collected hundreds of cases which had been investigated before
the tribunals of his own or of other countries.&nbsp; He relates
with the most minute and circumstantial detail, and with the most
unfaltering confidence, all the proceedings at the witches&rsquo;
Sabbath, the methods which the witches employed in transporting
themselves through the air, their transformations, their carnal
intercourse with the devil, their various means of injuring their
enemies, the signs that lead to their detection, their
confessions when condemned, and their demeanor at the
stake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something must be allowed for a lawyer&rsquo;s affection
toward a belief which had furnished so many
&ldquo;cases.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bodin&rsquo;s work had been
immediately prompted by the treatise &ldquo;De Prestigiis
D&aelig;nionum,&rdquo; written by John Wier, a German physician,
a treatise which is worth notice as an example of a transitional
form of opinion for which many analogies may be found in the
history both of religion and science.&nbsp; Wier <!-- page
265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>believed in demons, and in possession by demons, but
his practice as a physician had convinced him that the so-called
witches were patients and victims, that the devil took advantage
of their diseased condition to delude them, and that there was no
consent of an evil will on the part of the women.&nbsp; He argued
that the word in Leviticus translated &ldquo;witch&rdquo; meant
&ldquo;poisoner,&rdquo; and besought the princes of Europe to
hinder the further spilling of innocent blood.&nbsp; These
heresies of Wier threw Bodin into such a state of amazed
indignation that if he had been an ancient Jew instead of a
modern economical one, he would have rent his garments.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one had ever heard of pardon being accorded to
sorcerers;&rdquo; and probably the reason why Charles IX. died
young was because he had pardoned the sorcerer, Trios
Echelles!&nbsp; We must remember that this was in 1581, when the
great scientific movement of the Renaissance had hardly
begun&mdash;when Galileo was a youth of seventeen, and Kepler a
boy of ten.</p>
<p>But directly afterward, on the other side, came Montaigne,
whose sceptical acuteness could arrive at negatives without any
apparatus of method.&nbsp; A certain keen narrowness of nature
will secure a man from many absurd beliefs which the larger soul,
vibrating to more manifold influences, would have a long struggle
to part with.&nbsp; And so we find the charming, chatty
Montaigne&mdash;in one of the brightest of his essays, &ldquo;Des
Boiteux,&rdquo; where he declares that, from his own observation
of witches and sorcerers, he should have recommended them to be
treated with curative hellebore&mdash;stating in his own way a
pregnant doctrine, since taught more gravely.&nbsp; It seems to
him much less of a prodigy that men should lie, or that their
imaginations should deceive them, than that a human body should
be carried through the air on a broomstick, or up a chimney by
some unknown spirit.&nbsp; He thinks it a sad business to
persuade oneself that the test of truth lies in the multitude of
believers&mdash;&ldquo;en une prosse o&ugrave; les fols
surpassent de tant les sages en nombre.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ordinarily,
he has observed, when men have something stated to them as a
fact, they are more ready to explain it than to inquire whether
it is real: &ldquo;ils passent pardessus les propositions, mais
ils examinent les cons&eacute;quences; <i>ils laissent les
choses</i>, <i>et courent aux causes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a
sort of strong and generous ignorance which is as honorable and
courageous as science&mdash;&ldquo;ignorance pour laquelle
concevoir il n&rsquo;y a pas moins de science qu&rsquo;&agrave;
concevoir la science.&rdquo;&nbsp; And <i>&agrave; propos</i> of
the immense traditional evidence which weighed <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>with such
men as Bodin, he says&mdash;&ldquo;As for the proofs and
arguments founded on experience and facts, I do not pretend to
unravel these.&nbsp; What end of a thread is there to lay hold
of?&nbsp; I often cut them as Alexander did his knot.&nbsp;
<i>Apr&egrave;s tout</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est mettre ses conjectures
&acirc; bien haut prix</i>, <i>que d&rsquo;en faire cuire un
homme tout dif</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing like this, when it finds eager readers, is a sign that
the weather is changing; yet much later, namely, after 1665, when
the Royal Society had been founded, our own Glanvil, the author
of the &ldquo;Scepsis Scientifica,&rdquo; a work that was a
remarkable advance toward the true definition of the limits of
inquiry, and that won him his election as fellow of the society,
published an energetic vindication of the belief in witchcraft,
of which Mr. Lecky gives the following sketch:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Sadducismus Triumphatus,&rsquo;
which is probably the ablest book ever published in defence of
the superstition, opens with a striking picture of the rapid
progress of the scepticism in England.&nbsp; Everywhere, a
disbelief in witchcraft was becoming fashionable in the upper
classes; but it was a disbelief that arose entirely from a strong
sense of its antecedent improbability.&nbsp; All who were opposed
to the orthodox faith united in discrediting witchcraft.&nbsp;
They laughed at it, as palpably absurd, as involving the most
grotesque and ludicrous conceptions, as so essentially incredible
that it would be a waste of time to examine it.&nbsp; This spirit
had arisen since the Restoration, although the laws were still in
force, and although little or no direct reasoning had been
brought to bear upon the subject.&nbsp; In order to combat it,
Glanvil proceeded to examine the general question of the
credibility of the miraculous.&nbsp; He saw that the reason why
witchcraft was ridiculed was, because it was a phase of the
miraculous and the work of the devil; that the scepticism was
chiefly due to those who disbelieved in miracles and the devil;
and that the instances of witchcraft or possession in the Bible
were invariably placed on a level with those that were tried in
the law courts of England.&nbsp; That the evidence of the belief
was overwhelming, he firmly believed; and this, indeed, was
scarcely disputed; but, until the sense of <i>&agrave; priori</i>
improbability was removed, no possible accumulation of facts
would cause men to believe it.&nbsp; To that task he accordingly
addressed himself.&nbsp; Anticipating the idea and almost the
words of modern controversialists, he urged that there was such a
thing as a credulity of unbelief; and that those who believed so
strange a concurrence of delusions, as was necessary on the
supposition of the unreality of witchcraft, were far more
credulous than those who accepted the belief.&nbsp; He made his
very scepticism his principal weapon; and, analyzing with much
acuteness the <i>&agrave; priori</i> objections, he showed that
they rested upon an unwarrantable confidence in our knowledge of
the laws of the spirit world; that they implied the existence of
some strict analogy between the faculties of men and of spirits;
and that, as such analogy most probably did not exist, no
reasoning based on the <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>supposition
could dispense men from examining the evidence.&nbsp; He
concluded with a large collection of cases, the evidence of which
was, as he thought, incontestable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have quoted this sketch because Glanvil&rsquo;s argument
against the <i>&agrave; priori</i> objection of absurdity is
fatiguingly urged in relation to other alleged marvels which, to
busy people seriously occupied with the difficulties of affairs,
of science, or of art, seem as little worthy of examination as
a&euml;ronautic broomsticks.&nbsp; And also because we here see
Glanvil, in combating an incredulity that does not happen to be
his own, wielding that very argument of traditional evidence
which he had made the subject of vigorous attack in his
&ldquo;Scepsis Scientifica.&rdquo;&nbsp; But perhaps large minds
have been peculiarly liable to this fluctuation concerning the
sphere of tradition, because, while they have attacked its
misapplications, they have been the more solicited by the vague
sense that tradition is really the basis of our best life.&nbsp;
Our sentiments may be called organized traditions; and a large
part of our actions gather all their justification, all their
attraction and aroma, from the memory of the life lived, of the
actions done, before we were born.&nbsp; In the absence of any
profound research into psychological functions or into the
mysteries of inheritance, in the absence of any comprehensive
view of man&rsquo;s historical development and the dependence of
one age on another, a mind at all rich in sensibilities must
always have had an indefinite uneasiness in an undistinguishing
attack on the coercive influence of tradition.&nbsp; And this may
be the apology for the apparent inconsistency of Glanvil&rsquo;s
acute criticism on the one side, and his indignation at the
&ldquo;looser gentry,&rdquo; who laughed at the evidences for
witchcraft on the other.&nbsp; We have already taken up too much
space with this subject of witchcraft, else we should be tempted
to dwell on Sir Thomas Browne, who far surpassed Glanvil in
magnificent incongruity of opinion, and whose works are the most
remarkable combination existing, of witty sarcasm against ancient
nonsense and modern obsequiousness, with indications of a
capacious credulity.&nbsp; After all, we may be sharing what
seems to us the hardness of these men, who sat in their studies
and argued at their ease about a belief that would be reckoned to
have caused more misery and bloodshed than any other
superstition, if there had been no such thing as persecution on
the ground of religious opinion.</p>
<p>On this subject of Persecution, Mr. Lecky writes his best:
with clearness of conception, with calm justice, bent on
appreciating <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the necessary tendency of ideas, and
with an appropriateness of illustration that could be supplied
only by extensive and intelligent reading.&nbsp; Persecution, he
shows, is not in any sense peculiar to the Catholic Church; it is
a direct sequence of the doctrines that salvation is to be had
only within the Church, and that erroneous belief is
damnatory&mdash;doctrines held as fully by Protestant sects as by
the Catholics; and in proportion to its power, Protestantism has
been as persecuting as Catholicism.&nbsp; He maintains, in
opposition to the favorite modern notion of persecution defeating
its own object, that the Church, holding the dogma of exclusive
salvation, was perfectly consequent, and really achieved its end
of spreading one belief and quenching another, by calling in the
aid of the civil arm.&nbsp; Who will say that governments, by
their power over institutions and patronage, as well as over
punishment, have not power also over the interests and
inclinations of men, and over most of those external conditions
into which subjects are born, and which make them adopt the
prevalent belief as a second nature?&nbsp; Hence, to a sincere
believer in the doctrine of exclusive salvation, governments had
it in their power to save men from perdition; and wherever the
clergy were at the elbow of the civil arm, no matter whether they
were Catholic or Protestant, persecution was the result.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Compel them to come in&rdquo; was a rule that seemed
sanctioned by mercy, and the horrible sufferings it led men to
inflict seemed small to minds accustomed to contemplate, as a
perpetual source of motive, the eternal unmitigated miseries of a
hell that was the inevitable destination of a majority among
mankind.</p>
<p>It is a significant fact, noted by Mr. Lecky, that the only
two leaders of the Reformation who advocated tolerance were
Zuinglius and Socinus, both of them disbelievers in exclusive
salvation.&nbsp; And in corroboration of other evidence that the
chief triumphs of the Reformation were due to coercion, he
commends to the special attention of his readers the following
quotation from a work attributed without question to the famous
Protestant theologian, Jurieu, who had himself been hindered, as
a Protestant, from exercising his professional functions in
France, and was settled as pastor at Rotterdam.&nbsp; It should
be remembered that Jurieu&rsquo;s labors fell in the latter part
of the seventeenth century and in the beginning of the
eighteenth, and that he was the contemporary of Bayle, with whom
he was in bitter controversial hostility.&nbsp; He wrote, then,
at <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>a time when there was warm debate on the question of
Toleration; and it was his great object to vindicate himself and
his French fellow-Protestants from all laxity on this point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Peut on nier que le panganisme est
tomb&eacute; dans le monde par l&rsquo;autorit&eacute; des
empereurs Romains?&nbsp; On peut assurer sans temerit&eacute; que
le paganisme seroit encore debout, et que les trois quarts de
l&rsquo;Europe seroient encore payens si Constantin et ses
successeurs n&rsquo;avaient employ&eacute; leur autorit&eacute;
pour l&rsquo;abolir.&nbsp; Mais, je vous prie, de quelles voies
Dieu s&rsquo;est il servi dans ces derniers si&egrave;cles pour
r&eacute;tablir la veritable religion dans
l&rsquo;Occident?&nbsp; <i>Les rois de Su&egrave;de</i>, <i>ceux
de Danemarck</i>, <i>ceux d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>, <i>les
magistrats souverains de Suisse</i>, <i>des Pa&iuml;s Bas</i>,
<i>des villes livres d&rsquo;Allemagne</i>, <i>les princes
&eacute;lecteurs</i>, <i>et autres princes souverains de
l&rsquo;empire</i>, <i>n&rsquo;ont ils pas emploi&eacute; leur
autorit&eacute; pour abbattre le Papisme</i>?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, wherever the tremendous alternative of everlasting
torments is believed in&mdash;believed in so that it becomes a
motive determining the life&mdash;not only persecution, but every
other form of severity and gloom are the legitimate
consequences.&nbsp; There is much ready declamation in these days
against the spirit of asceticism and against zeal for doctrinal
conversion; but surely the macerated form of a Saint Francis, the
fierce denunciations of a Saint Dominic, the groans and prayerful
wrestlings of the Puritan who seasoned his bread with tears and
made all pleasurable sensation sin, are more in keeping with the
contemplation of unending anguish as the destiny of a vast
multitude whose nature we share, than the rubicund cheerfulness
of some modern divines, who profess to unite a smiling liberalism
with a well-bred and tacit but unshaken confidence in the reality
of the bottomless pit.&nbsp; But, in fact, as Mr. Lecky
maintains, that awful image, with its group of associated dogmas
concerning the inherited curse, and the damnation of unbaptized
infants, of heathens, and of heretics, has passed away from what
he is fond of calling &ldquo;the realizations&rdquo; of
Christendom.&nbsp; These things are no longer the objects of
practical belief.&nbsp; They may be mourned for in encyclical
letters; bishops may regret them; doctors of divinity may sign
testimonials to the excellent character of these decayed beliefs;
but for the mass of Christians they are no more influential than
unrepealed but forgotten statutes.&nbsp; And with these dogmas
has melted away the strong basis for the defence of
persecution.&nbsp; No man now writes eager vindications of
himself and his colleagues from the suspicion of adhering to the
principle of toleration.&nbsp; And this momentous change, it is
Mr. Lecky&rsquo;s object to show, is due to that concurrence of
<!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>conditions which he has chosen to call &ldquo;the
advance of the Spirit of Rationalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other parts of his work, where he attempts to trace the
action of the same conditions on the acceptance of miracles and
on other chief phases of our historical development, Mr. Lecky
has laid himself open to considerable criticism.&nbsp; The
chapters on the &ldquo;Miracles of the Church,&rdquo; the
&aelig;sthetic, scientific, and moral development of Rationalism,
the Secularization of Politics, and the Industrial History of
Rationalism, embrace a wide range of diligently gathered facts;
but they are nowhere illuminated by a sufficiently clear
conception and statement of the agencies at work, or the mode of
their action, in the gradual modification of opinion and of
life.&nbsp; The writer frequently impresses us as being in a
state of hesitation concerning his own standing-point, which may
form a desirable stage in private meditation but not in published
exposition.&nbsp; Certain epochs in theoretic conception, certain
considerations, which should be fundamental to his survey, are
introduced quite incidentally in a sentence or two, or in a note
which seems to be an afterthought.&nbsp; Great writers and their
ideas are touched upon too slightly and with too little
discrimination, and important theories are sometimes
characterized with a rashness which conscientious revision will
correct.&nbsp; There is a fatiguing use of vague or shifting
phrases, such as &ldquo;modern civilization,&rdquo; &ldquo;spirit
of the age,&rdquo; &ldquo;tone of thought,&rdquo;
&ldquo;intellectual type of the age,&rdquo; &ldquo;bias of the
imagination,&rdquo; &ldquo;habits of religious thought,&rdquo;
unbalanced by any precise definition; and the spirit of
rationalism is sometimes treated of as if it lay outside the
specific mental activities of which it is a generalized
expression.&nbsp; Mr. Curdle&rsquo;s famous definition of the
dramatic unities as &ldquo;a sort of a general oneness,&rdquo; is
not totally false; but such luminousness as it has could only be
perceived by those who already knew what the unities were.&nbsp;
Mr. Lecky has the advantage of being strongly impressed with the
great part played by the emotions in the formation of opinion,
and with the high complexity of the causes at work in social
evolution; but he frequently writes as if he had never yet
distinguished between the complexity of the conditions that
produce prevalent states of mind and the inability of particular
minds to give distinct reasons for the preferences or persuasions
produced by those states.&nbsp; In brief, he does not
discriminate, or does not help his reader to discriminate,
between objective complexity and subjective confusion.&nbsp; But
the most muddle-headed <!-- page 271--><a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>gentleman
who represents the spirit of the age by observing, as he settles
his collar, that the development theory is quite &ldquo;the
thing&rdquo; is a result of definite processes, if we could only
trace them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mental attitudes,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;predispositions,&rdquo; however vague in consciousness,
have not vague causes, any more than the &ldquo;blind motions of
the spring&rdquo; in plants and animals.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Rationalism&rdquo; has the misfortune, shared
by most words in this gray world, of being somewhat
equivocal.&nbsp; This evil may be nearly overcome by careful
preliminary definition; but Mr. Lecky does not supply this, and
the original specific application of the word to a particular
phase of biblical interpretation seems to have clung about his
use of it with a misleading effect.&nbsp; Through some parts of
his book he appears to regard the grand characteristic of modern
thought and civilization, compared with ancient, as a radiation
in the first instance from a change in religious
conceptions.&nbsp; The supremely important fact, that the gradual
reduction of all phenomena within the sphere of established law,
which carries as a consequence the rejection of the miraculous,
has its determining current in the development of physical
science, seems to have engaged comparatively little of his
attention; at least, he gives it no prominence.&nbsp; The great
conception of universal regular sequence, without partiality and
without caprice&mdash;the conception which is the most potent
force at work in the modification of our faith, and of the
practical form given to our sentiments&mdash;could only grow out
of that patient watching of external fact, and that silencing of
preconceived notions, which are urged upon the mind by the
problems of physical science.</p>
<p>There is not room here to explain and justify the impressions
of dissatisfaction which have been briefly indicated, but a
serious writer like Mr. Lecky will not find such suggestions
altogether useless.&nbsp; The objections, even the
misunderstandings, of a reader who is not careless or
ill-disposed, may serve to stimulate an author&rsquo;s vigilance
over his thoughts as well as his style.&nbsp; It would be
gratifying to see some future proof that Mr. Lecky has acquired
juster views than are implied in the assertion that philosophers
of the sensational school &ldquo;can never rise to the conception
of the disinterested;&rdquo; and that he has freed himself from
all temptation to that mingled laxity of statement and
ill-pitched elevation of tone which are painfully present in the
closing pages of his second volume.</p>

<p>The inventor of movable types, says the venerable
Teufelsdr&ouml;ckh, was disbanding hired armies, cashiering most
kings and senates, and creating a whole new democratic
world.&nbsp; Has any one yet said what great things are being
done by the men who are trying to banish ugliness from our
streets and our homes, and to make both the outside and inside of
our dwellings worthy of a world where there are forests and
flower-tressed meadows, and the plumage of birds; where the
insects carry lessons of color on their wings, and even the
surface of a stagnant pool will show us the wonders of
iridescence and the most delicate forms of leafage?&nbsp; They,
too, are modifying opinions, for they are modifying men&rsquo;s
moods and habits, which are the mothers of opinions, having quite
as much to do with their formation as the responsible
father&mdash;Reason.&nbsp; Think of certain hideous manufacturing
towns where the piety is chiefly a belief in copious perdition,
and the pleasure is chiefly gin.&nbsp; The dingy surface of wall
pierced by the ugliest windows, the staring shop-fronts,
paper-hangings, carpets, brass and gilt mouldings, and
advertising placards, have an effect akin to that of malaria; it
is easy to understand that with such surroundings there is more
belief in cruelty than in beneficence, and that the best earthly
bliss attainable is the dulling of the external senses.&nbsp; For
it is a fatal mistake to suppose that ugliness which is taken for
beauty will answer all the purposes of beauty; the subtle
relation between all kinds of truth and fitness in our life
forbids that bad taste should ever be harmless to our moral
sensibility or our intellectual discernment; and&mdash;more than
that&mdash;as it is probable that fine musical harmonies have a
sanative influence over our bodily organization, it is also
probable <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>that just coloring and lovely
combinations of lines may be necessary to the complete well-being
of our systems apart from any conscious delight in them.&nbsp; A
savage may indulge in discordant chuckles and shrieks and
gutturals, and think that they please the gods, but it does not
follow that his frame would not be favorably wrought upon by the
vibrations of a grand church organ.&nbsp; One sees a person
capable of choosing the worst style of wall-paper become suddenly
afflicted by its ugliness under an attack of illness.&nbsp; And
if an evil state of blood and lymph usually goes along with an
evil state of mind, who shall say that the ugliness of our
streets, the falsity of our ornamentation, the vulgarity of our
upholstery, have not something to do with those bad tempers which
breed false conclusions?</p>
<p>On several grounds it is possible to make a more speedy and
extensive application of artistic reform to our interior
decoration than to our external architecture.&nbsp; One of these
grounds is that most of our ugly buildings must stand; we cannot
afford to pull them down.&nbsp; But every year we are decorating
interiors afresh, and people of modest means may benefit by the
introduction of beautiful designs into stucco ornaments,
paper-hangings, draperies, and carpets.&nbsp; Fine taste in the
decoration of interiors is a benefit that spreads from the palace
to the clerk&rsquo;s house with one parlor.</p>
<p>All honor, then, to the architect who has zealously vindicated
the claim of internal ornamentation to be a part of the
architect&rsquo;s function, and has labored to rescue that form
of art which is most closely connected with the sanctities and
pleasures of our hearths from the hands of uncultured
tradesmen.&nbsp; All the nation ought at present to know that
this effort is peculiarly associated with the name of Mr. Owen
Jones; and those who are most disposed to dispute with the
architect about his coloring must at least recognize the high
artistic principle which has directed his attention to colored
ornamentation as a proper branch of architecture.&nbsp; One
monument of his effort in this way is his &ldquo;Grammar of
Ornament,&rdquo; of which a new and cheaper edition has just been
issued.&nbsp; The one point in which it differs from the original
and more expensive edition, viz., the reduction in the size of
the pages (the amount of matter and number of plates are
unaltered), is really an advantage; it is now a very manageable
folio, and when the reader is in a lounging mood may be held
easily on the knees.&nbsp; It is a magnificent book; and those
who know no more of it than the title should be told that they
will find in it a pictorial history <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>of
ornamental design, from its rudimentary condition as seen in the
productions of savage tribes, through all the other great types
of art&mdash;the Egyptian, Assyrian, ancient Persian, Greek,
Roman, Byzantine, Arabian, Moresque, Mohammedan-Persian, Indian,
Celtic, Medi&aelig;val, Renaissance, Elizabethan, and
Italian.&nbsp; The letter-press consists, first, of an
introductory statement of fundamental principles of
ornamentation&mdash;principles, says the author, which will be
found to have been obeyed more or less instinctively by all
nations in proportion as their art has been a genuine product of
the national genius; and, secondly, of brief historical essays,
some of them contributed by other eminent artists, presenting a
commentary on each characteristic series of illustrations, with
the useful appendage of bibliographical lists.</p>
<p>The title &ldquo;Grammar of Ornament&rdquo; is so far
appropriate that it indicates what Mr. Owen Jones is most anxious
to be understood concerning the object of his work, namely, that
it is intended to illustrate historically the application of
principles, and not to present a collection of models for mere
copyists.&nbsp; The plates correspond to examples in syntax, not
to be repeated parrot-like, but to be studied as embodiments of
syntactical principles.&nbsp; There is a logic of form which
cannot be departed from in ornamental design without a
corresponding remoteness from perfection; unmeaning, irrelevant
lines are as bad as irrelevant words or clauses, that tend no
whither.&nbsp; And as a suggestion toward the origination of
fresh ornamental design, the work concludes with some beautiful
drawings of leaves and flowers from nature, that the student,
tracing in them the simple laws of form which underlie an immense
variety in beauty, may the better discern the method by which the
same laws were applied in the finest decorative work of the past,
and may have all the clearer prospect of the unexhausted
possibilities of freshness which lie before him, if, refraining
from mere imitation, he will seek only such likeness to existing
forms of ornamental art as arises from following like principles
of combination.</p>
<h3><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>X.&nbsp; ADDRESS TO WORKING MEN, BY
FELIX HOLT.</h3>
<p>Fellow-Workmen: I am not going to take up your time by
complimenting you.&nbsp; It has been the fashion to compliment
kings and other authorities when they have come into power, and
to tell them that, under their wise and beneficent rule,
happiness would certainly overflow the land.&nbsp; But the end
has not always corresponded to that beginning.&nbsp; If it were
true that we who work for wages had more of the wisdom and virtue
necessary to the right use of power than has been shown by the
aristocratic and mercantile classes, we should not glory much in
that fact, or consider that it carried with it any near approach
to infallibility.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there has been too much complimenting of that
sort; and whenever a speaker, whether he is one of ourselves or
not, wastes our time in boasting or flattery, I say, let us hiss
him.&nbsp; If we have the beginning of wisdom, which is, to know
a little truth about ourselves, we know that as a body we are
neither very wise nor very virtuous.&nbsp; And to prove this, I
will not point specially to our own habits and doings, but to the
general state of the country.&nbsp; Any nation that had within it
a majority of men&mdash;and we are the majority&mdash;possessed
of much wisdom and virtue, would not tolerate the bad practices,
the commercial lying and swindling, the poisonous adulteration of
goods, the retail cheating, and the political bribery which are
carried on boldly in the midst of us.&nbsp; A majority has the
power of creating a public opinion.&nbsp; We could groan and hiss
before we had the franchise: if we had groaned and hissed in the
right place, if we had discerned better between good and evil, if
the multitude of us artisans, and factory hands, and miners, and
laborers of all sorts, had been skilful, faithful, well-judging,
industrious, sober&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t see how there can be
wisdom and virtue anywhere without these qualities&mdash;we
should have made an audience that would have shamed the other
classes out of their share in the national vices.&nbsp; We should
have had better members of Parliament, better religious <!-- page
276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>teachers, honester tradesmen, fewer foolish demagogues,
less impudence in infamous and brutal men; and we should not have
had among us the abomination of men calling themselves religious
while living in splendor on ill-gotten gains.&nbsp; I say, it is
not possible for any society in which there is a very large body
of wise and virtuous men to be as vicious as our society
is&mdash;to have as low a standard of right and wrong, to have so
much belief in falsehood, or to have so degrading, barbarous a
notion of what pleasure is, or of what justly raises a man above
his fellows.&nbsp; Therefore, let us have none with this nonsense
about our being much better than the rest of our countryman, or
the pretence that that was a reason why we ought to have such an
extension of the franchise as has been given to us.&nbsp; The
reason for our having the franchise, as I want presently to show,
lies somewhere else than in our personal good qualities, and does
not in the least lie in any high betting chance that a delegate
is a better man than a duke, or that a Sheffield grinder is a
better man than any one of the firm he works for.</p>
<p>However, we have got our franchise now.&nbsp; We have been
sarcastically called in the House of Commons the future masters
of the country; and if that sarcasm contains any truth, it seems
to me that the first thing we had better think of is, our heavy
responsibility; that is to say, the terrible risk we run of
working mischief and missing good, as others have done before
us.&nbsp; Suppose certain men, discontented with the irrigation
of a country which depended for all its prosperity on the right
direction being given to the waters of a great river, had got the
management of the irrigation before they were quite sure how
exactly it could be altered for the better, or whether they could
command the necessary agency for such on alteration.&nbsp; Those
men would have a difficult and dangerous business on their hands;
and the more sense, feeling, and knowledge they had, the more
they would be likely to tremble rather than to triumph.&nbsp; Our
situation is not altogether unlike theirs.&nbsp; For general
prosperity and well-being is a vast crop, that like the corn in
Egypt can be come at, not at all by hurried snatching, but only
by a well-judged patient process; and whether our political power
will be any good to us now we have got it, must depend entirely
on the means and materials&mdash;the knowledge, ability, and
honesty we have at command.&nbsp; These three things are the only
conditions on which we can get any lasting benefit, as every
clever workman among us knows: he knows that for an article to be
worth much there must be a good invention or plan to go upon,
there must be a well-prepared <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>material,
and there must be skilful and honest work in carrying out the
plan.&nbsp; And by this test we may try those who want to be our
leaders.&nbsp; Have they anything to offer us besides indignant
talk?&nbsp; When they tell us we ought to have this, that, or the
other thing, can they explain to us any reasonable, fair, safe
way of getting it?&nbsp; Can they argue in favor of a particular
change by showing us pretty closely how the change is likely to
work?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to decry a just indignation; on
the contrary, I should like it to be more thorough and
general.&nbsp; A wise man, more than two thousand years ago, when
he was asked what would most tend to lessen injustice in the
world, said, &ldquo;If every bystander felt as indignant at a
wrong as if he himself were the sufferer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us
cherish such indignation.&nbsp; But the long-growing evils of a
great nation are a tangled business, asking for a good deal more
than indignation in order to be got rid of.&nbsp; Indignation is
a fine war-horse, but the war-horse must be ridden by a man: it
must be ridden by rationality, skill, courage, armed with the
right weapons, and taking definite aim.</p>
<p>We have reason to be discontented with many things, and,
looking back either through the history of England to much
earlier generations or to the legislation and administrations of
later times, we are justified in saying that many of the evils
under which our country now suffers are the consequences of
folly, ignorance, neglect, or self-seeking in those who, at
different times have wielded the powers of rank, office, and
money.&nbsp; But the more bitterly we feel this, the more loudly
we utter it, the stronger is the obligation we lay on ourselves
to beware, lest we also, by a too hasty wresting of measures
which seem to promise an immediate partial relief, make a worse
time of it for our own generation, and leave a bad inheritance to
our children.&nbsp; The deepest curse of wrong-doing, whether of
the foolish or wicked sort, is that its effects are difficult to
be undone.&nbsp; I suppose there is hardly anything more to be
shuddered at than that part of the history of disease which shows
how, when a man injures his constitution by a life of vicious
excess, his children and grandchildren inherit diseased bodies
and minds, and how the effects of that unhappy inheritance
continue to spread beyond our calculation.&nbsp; This is only one
example of the law by which human lives are linked together;
another example of what we complain of when we point to our
pauperism, to the brutal ignorance of multitudes among our fellow
countrymen, to the weight of taxation laid on us by blamable
wars, to the wasteful channels made for the <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>public
money, to the expense and trouble of getting justice, and call
these the effects of bad rule.&nbsp; This is the law that we all
bear the yoke of, the law of no man&rsquo;s making, and which no
man can undo.&nbsp; Everybody now sees an example of it in the
case of Ireland.&nbsp; We who are living now are sufferers by the
wrong-doing of those who lived before us; we are the sufferers by
each other&rsquo;s wrong-doing; and the children who come after
us are and will be sufferers from the same causes.&nbsp; Will any
man say he doesn&rsquo;t care for that law&mdash;it is nothing to
him&mdash;what he wants is to better himself?&nbsp; With what
face then will he complain of any injury?&nbsp; If he says that
in politics or in any sort of social action he will not care to
know what are likely to be the consequences to others besides
himself, he is defending the very worst doings that have brought
about his discontent.&nbsp; He might as well say that there is no
better rule needful for men than that each should tug and drive
for what will please him, without caring how that tugging will
act on the fine widespread network of society in which he is fast
meshed.&nbsp; If any man taught that as a doctrine, we should
know him for a fool.&nbsp; But there are men who act upon it;
every scoundrel, for example, whether he is a rich religious
scoundrel who lies and cheats on a large scale, and will perhaps
come and ask you to send him to Parliament, or a poor
pocket-picking scoundrel, who will steal your loose pence while
you are listening round the platform.&nbsp; None of us are so
ignorant as not to know that a society, a nation is held together
by just the opposite doctrine and action&mdash;by the dependence
of men on each other and the sense they have of a common interest
in preventing injury.&nbsp; And we working men are, I think, of
all classes the last that can afford to forget this; for if we
did we should be much like sailors cutting away the timbers of
our own ship to warm our grog with.&nbsp; For what else is the
meaning of our trades-unions?&nbsp; What else is the meaning of
every flag we carry, every procession we make, every crowd we
collect for the sake of making some protest on behalf of our body
as receivers of wages, if not this: that it is our interest to
stand by each other, and that this being the common interest, no
one of us will try to make a good bargain for himself without
considering what will be good for his fellows?&nbsp; And every
member of a union believes that the wider he can spread his
union, the stronger and surer will be the effect of it.&nbsp; So
I think I shall be borne out in saying that a working man who can
put two and two together, or take three from four and see what
will be the remainder, can understand that a society, to be well
off, must be <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>made up chiefly of men who consider
the general good as well as their own.</p>
<p>Well, but taking the world as it is&mdash;and this is one way
we must take it when we want to find out how it can be
improved&mdash;no society is made up of a single class: society
stands before us like that wonderful piece of life, the human
body, with all its various parts depending on one another, and
with a terrible liability to get wrong because of that delicate
dependence.&nbsp; We all know how many diseases the human body is
apt to suffer from, and how difficult it is even for the doctors
to find out exactly where the seat or beginning of the disorder
is.&nbsp; That is because the body is made up of so many various
parts, all related to each other, or likely all to feel the
effect if any one of them goes wrong.&nbsp; It is somewhat the
same with our old nations or societies.&nbsp; No society ever
stood long in the world without getting to be composed of
different classes.&nbsp; Now, it is all pretence to say that
there is no such thing as class interest.&nbsp; It is clear that
if any particular number of men get a particular benefit from any
existing institution, they are likely to band together, in order
to keep up that benefit and increase it, until it is perceived to
be unfair and injurious to another large number, who get
knowledge and strength enough to set up a resistance.&nbsp; And
this, again, has been part of the history of every great society
since history began.&nbsp; But the simple reason for this being,
that any large body of men is likely to have more of stupidity,
narrowness, and greed than of farsightedness and generosity, it
is plain that the number who resist unfairness and injury are in
danger of becoming injurious in their turn.&nbsp; And in this way
a justifiable resistance has become a damaging convulsion, making
everything worse instead of better.&nbsp; This has been seen so
often that we ought to profit a little by the experience.&nbsp;
So long as there is selfishness in men; so long as they have not
found out for themselves institutions which express and carry
into practice the truth, that the highest interest of mankind
must at last be a common and not a divided interest; so long as
the gradual operation of steady causes has not made that truth a
part of every man&rsquo;s knowledge and feeling, just as we now
not only know that it is good for our health to be cleanly, but
feel that cleanliness is only another word for comfort, which is
the under-side or lining of all pleasure; so long, I say as men
wink at their own knowingness, or hold their heads high because
they have got an advantage over their fellows; so long class
interest will be in danger of making itself felt
injuriously.&nbsp; <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>No set of men will get any sort of
power without being in danger of wanting more than their right
share.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, it is just as certain that
no set of men will get angry at having less than their right
share, and set up a claim on that ground, without falling into
just the same danger of exacting too much, and exacting it in
wrong ways.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s human nature we have got to work
with all round, and nothing else.&nbsp; That seems like saying
something very commonplace&mdash;nay, obvious; as if one should
say that where there are hands there are mouths.&nbsp; Yet, to
hear a good deal of the speechifying and to see a good deal of
the action that go forward, one might suppose it was
forgotten.</p>
<p>But I come back to this: that, in our old society, there are
old institutions, and among them the various distinctions and
inherited advantages of classes, which have shaped themselves
along with all the wonderful slow-growing system of things made
up of our laws, our commerce, and our stores of all sorts,
whether in material objects, such as buildings and machinery, or
in knowledge, such as scientific thought and professional
skill.&nbsp; Just as in that case I spoke of before, the
irrigation of a country, which must absolutely have its water
distributed or it will bear no crop; there are the old channels,
the old banks, and the old pumps, which must be used as they are
until new and better have been prepared, or the structure of the
old has been gradually altered.&nbsp; But it would be
fool&rsquo;s work to batter down a pump only because a better
might be made, when you had no machinery ready for a new one: it
would be wicked work, if villages lost their crops by it.&nbsp;
Now the only safe way by which society can be steadily improved
and our worst evils reduced, is not by any attempt to do away
directly with the actually existing class distinctions and
advantages, as if everybody could have the same sort of work, or
lead the same sort of life (which none of my hearers are stupid
enough to suppose), but by the turning of class interests into
class functions or duties.&nbsp; What I mean is, that each class
should be urged by the surrounding conditions to perform its
particular work under the strong pressure of responsibility to
the nation at large; that our public affairs should be got into a
state in which there should be no impunity for foolish or
faithless conduct.&nbsp; In this way the public judgment would
sift out incapability and dishonesty from posts of high charge,
and even personal ambition would necessarily become of a worthier
sort, since the desires of the most selfish men must be a good
deal shaped by the opinions of those around them; and for <!--
page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>one person to put on a cap and bells, or to go about
dishonest or paltry ways of getting rich that he may spend a vast
sum of money in having more finery than his neighbors, he must be
pretty sure of a crowd who will applaud him.&nbsp; Now, changes
can only be good in proportion as they help to bring about this
sort of result: in proportion as they put knowledge in the place
of ignorance, and fellow-feeling in the place of
selfishness.&nbsp; In the course of that substitution class
distinctions must inevitably change their character, and
represent the varying duties of men, not their varying
interests.&nbsp; But this end will not come by impatience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Day will not break the sooner because we get up before the
twilight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still less will it come by mere undoing,
or change merely as change.&nbsp; And moreover, if we believed
that it would be unconditionally hastened by our getting the
franchise, we should be what I call superstitious men, believing
in magic, or the production of a result by hocus-pocus.&nbsp; Our
getting the franchise will greatly hasten that good end in
proportion only as every one of us has the knowledge, the
foresight, the conscience, that will make him well-judging and
scrupulous in the use of it.&nbsp; The nature of things in this
world has been determined for us beforehand, and in such a way
that no ship can be expected to sail well on a difficult voyage,
and reach the right port, unless it is well manned: the nature of
the winds and the waves, of the timbers, the sails, and the
cordage, will not accommodate itself to drunken, mutinous
sailors.</p>
<p>You will not suspect me of wanting to preach any cant to you,
or of joining in the pretence that everything is in a fine way,
and need not be made better.&nbsp; What I am striving to keep in
our minds is the care, the precaution, with which we should go
about making things better, so that the public order may not be
destroyed, so that no fatal shock may be given to this society of
ours, this living body in which our lives are bound up.&nbsp;
After the Reform Bill of 1832 I was in an election riot, which
showed me clearly, on a small scale, what public disorder must
always be; and I have never forgotten that the riot was brought
about chiefly by the agency of dishonest men who professed to be
on the people&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Now, the danger hanging over
change is great, just in proportion as it tends to produce such
disorder by giving any large number of ignorant men, whose
notions of what is good are of a low and brutal sort, the belief
that they have got power into their hands, and may do pretty much
as they like.&nbsp; If any one can look round us and say that he
sees no signs of any such danger <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>now, and
that our national condition is running along like a clear
broadening stream, safe not to get choked with mud, I call him a
cheerful man: perhaps he does his own gardening, and seldom taken
exercise far away from home.&nbsp; To us who have no gardens, and
often walk abroad, it is plain that we can never get into a bit
of a crowd but we must rub clothes with a set of roughs, who have
the worst vices of the worst rich&mdash;who are gamblers, sots,
libertines, knaves, or else mere sensual simpletons and
victims.&nbsp; They are the ugly crop that has sprung up while
the stewards have been sleeping; they are the multiplying brood
begotten by parents who have been left without all teaching save
that of a too craving body, without all well-being save the
fading delusions of drugged beer and gin.&nbsp; They are the
hideous margin of society, at one edge drawing toward it the
undesigning ignorant poor, at the other darkening imperceptibly
into the lowest criminal class.&nbsp; Here is one of the evils
which cannot be got rid of quickly, and against which any of us
who have got sense, decency, and instruction have need to
watch.&nbsp; That these degraded fellow-men could really get the
mastery in a persistent disobedience to the laws and in a
struggle to subvert order, I do not believe; but wretched
calamities must come from the very beginning of such a struggle,
and the continuance of it would be a civil war, in which the
inspiration on both sides might soon cease to be even a false
notion of good, and might become the direct savage impulse of
ferocity.&nbsp; We have all to see to it that we do not help to
rouse what I may call the savage beast in the breasts of our
generation&mdash;that we do not help to poison the nation&rsquo;s
blood, and make richer provision for bestiality to come.&nbsp; We
know well enough that oppressors have sinned in this
way&mdash;that oppression has notoriously made men mad; and we
are determined to resist oppression.&nbsp; But let us, if
possible, show that we can keep sane in our resistance, and shape
our means more and more reasonably toward the least harmful, and
therefore the speediest, attainment of our end.&nbsp; Let us, I
say, show that our spirits are too strong to be driven mad, but
can keep that sober determination which alone gives mastery over
the adaptation of means.&nbsp; And a first guarantee of this
sanity will be to act as if we understood that the fundamental
duty of a government is to preserve order, to enforce obedience
of the laws.&nbsp; It has been held hitherto that a man can be
depended on as a guardian of order only when he has much money
and comfort to lose.&nbsp; But a better state of things would be,
that men who had little money and not much comfort <!-- page
283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>should still be guardians of order, because they had
sense to see that disorder would do no good, and had a heart of
justice, pity, and fortitude, to keep them from making more
misery only because they felt some misery themselves.&nbsp; There
are thousands of artisans who have already shown this fine
spirit, and have endured much with patient heroism.&nbsp; If such
a spirit spread, and penetrated us all, we should soon become the
masters of the country in the best sense and to the best
ends.&nbsp; For, the public order being preserved, there can be
no government in future that will not be determined by our
insistance on our fair and practicable demands.&nbsp; It is only
by disorder that our demands will be choked, that we shall find
ourselves lost among a brutal rabble, with all the intelligence
of the country opposed to us, and see government in the shape of
guns that will sweep us down in the ignoble martyrdom of
fools.</p>
<p>It has been a too common notion that to insist much on the
preservation of order is the part of a selfish aristocracy and a
selfish commercial class, because among these, in the nature of
things, have been found the opponents of change.&nbsp; I am a
Radical; and, what is more, I am not a Radical with a title, or a
French cook, or even an entrance into fine society.&nbsp; I
expect great changes, and I desire them.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
expect them to come in a hurry, by mere inconsiderate
sweeping.&nbsp; A Hercules with a big besom is a fine thing for a
filthy stable, but not for weeding a seed-bed, where his besom
would soon make a barren floor.</p>
<p>That is old-fashioned talk, some one may say.&nbsp; We know
all that.</p>
<p>Yes, when things are put in an extreme way, most people think
they know them; but, after all, they are comparatively few who
see the small degrees by which those extremes are arrived at, or
have the resolution and self-control to resist the little
impulses by which they creep on surely toward a fatal end.&nbsp;
Does anybody set out meaning to ruin himself, or to drink himself
to death, or to waste his life so that he becomes a despicable
old man, a superannuated nuisance, like a fly in winter.&nbsp;
Yet there are plenty, of whose lot this is the pitiable
story.&nbsp; Well now, supposing us all to have the best
intentions, we working men, as a body, run some risk of bringing
evil on the nation in that unconscious manner&mdash;half
hurrying, half pushed in a jostling march toward an end we are
not thinking of.&nbsp; For just as there are many things which we
know better and feel much more strongly than the richer,
softer-handed classes can know or feel them; so there are many
things&mdash;many <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>precious benefits&mdash;which we, by
the very fact of our privations, our lack of leisure and
instruction, are not so likely to be aware of and take into our
account.&nbsp; Those precious benefits form a chief part of what
I may call the common estate of society: a wealth over and above
buildings, machinery, produce, shipping, and so on, though
closely connected with these; a wealth of a more delicate kind,
that we may more unconsciously bring into danger, doing harm and
not knowing that we do it.&nbsp; I mean that treasure of
knowledge, science, poetry, refinement of thought, feeling, and
manners, great memories and the interpretation of great records,
which is carried on from the minds of one generation to the minds
of another.&nbsp; This is something distinct from the indulgences
of luxury and the pursuit of vain finery; and one of the
hardships in the lot of working men is that they have been for
the most part shut out from sharing in this treasure.&nbsp; It
can make a man&rsquo;s life very great, very full of delight,
though he has no smart furniture and no horses: it also yields a
great deal of discovery that corrects error, and of invention
that lessens bodily pain, and must at least make life easier for
all.</p>
<p>Now the security of this treasure demands, not only the
preservation of order, but a certain patience on our part with
many institutions and facts of various kinds, especially touching
the accumulation of wealth, which from the light we stand in, we
are more likely to discern the evil than the good of.&nbsp; It is
constantly the task of practical wisdom not to say, &ldquo;This
is good, and I will have it,&rdquo; but to say, &ldquo;This is
the less of two unavoidable evils, and I will bear
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this treasure of knowledge, which consists
in the fine activity, the exalted vision of many minds, is bound
up at present with conditions which have much evil in them.&nbsp;
Just as in the case of material wealth and its distribution we
are obliged to take the selfishness and weaknesses of human
nature into account, and however we insist that men might act
better, are forced, unless we are fanatical simpletons, to
consider how they are likely to act; so in this matter of the
wealth that is carried in men&rsquo;s minds, we have to reflect
that the too absolute predominance of a class whose wants have
been of a common sort, who are chiefly struggling to get better
and more food, clothing, shelter, and bodily recreation, may lead
to hasty measures for the sake of having things more fairly
shared, which, even if they did not fail of their object, would
at last debase the life of the nation.&nbsp; Do anything which
will throw the classes who hold the treasures of
knowledge&mdash;nay, I may say, the treasure of refined <!-- page
285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>needs&mdash;into the background, cause them to withdraw
from public affairs, stop too suddenly any of the sources by
which their leisure and ease are furnished, rob them of the
chances by which they may be influential and pre-eminent, and you
do something as short-sighted as the acts of France and Spain
when in jealousy and wrath, not altogether unprovoked, they drove
from among them races and classes that held the traditions of
handicraft and agriculture.&nbsp; You injure your own inheritance
and the inheritance of your children.&nbsp; You may truly say
that this which I call the common estate of society has been
anything but common to you; but the same may be said, by many of
us, of the sunlight and the air, of the sky and the fields, of
parks and holiday games.&nbsp; Nevertheless that these blessings
exist makes life worthier to us, and urges us the more to
energetic, likely means of getting our share in them; and I say,
let us watch carefully, lest we do anything to lessen this
treasure which is held in the minds of men, while we exert
ourselves, first of all, and to the very utmost, that we and our
children may share in all its benefits.&nbsp; Yes; exert
ourselves to the utmost, to break the yoke of ignorance.&nbsp; If
we demand more leisure, more ease in our lives, let us show that
we don&rsquo;t deserve the reproach of wanting to shirk that
industry which, in some form or other, every man, whether rich or
poor, should feel himself as much bound to as he is bound to
decency.&nbsp; Let us show that we want to have some time and
strength left to us, that we may use it, not for brutal
indulgence, but for the rational exercise of the faculties which
make us men.&nbsp; Without this no political measures can benefit
us.&nbsp; No political institution will alter the nature of
Ignorance, or hinder it from producing vice and misery.&nbsp; Let
Ignorance start how it will, it must run the same round of low
appetites, poverty, slavery, and superstition.&nbsp; Some of us
know this well&mdash;nay, I will say, feel it; for knowledge of
this kind cuts deep; and to us it is one of the most painful
facts belonging to our condition that there are numbers of our
fellow-workmen who are so far from feeling in the same way, that
they never use the imperfect opportunities already offered them
for giving their children some schooling, but turn their little
ones of tender age into bread-winners, often at cruel tasks,
exposed to the horrible infection of childish vice.&nbsp; Of
course, the causes of these hideous things go a long way
back.&nbsp; Parents&rsquo; misery has made parents&rsquo;
wickedness.&nbsp; But we, who are still blessed with the hearts
of fathers and the consciences of men&mdash;we who have some
knowledge of the curse entailed on broods of creatures in <!--
page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>human shape, whose enfeebled bodies and dull perverted
minds are mere centres of uneasiness in whom even appetite is
feeble and joy impossible&mdash;I say we are bound to use all the
means at our command to help in putting a stop to this
horror.&nbsp; Here, it seems to me, is a way in which we may use
extended co-operation among us to the most momentous of all
purposes, and make conditions of enrolment that would strengthen
all educational measures.&nbsp; It is true enough that there is a
low sense of parental duties in the nation at large, and that
numbers who have no excuse in bodily hardship seem to think it a
light thing to beget children, to bring human beings with all
their tremendous possibilities into this difficult world, and
then take little heed how they are disciplined and furnished for
the perilous journey they are sent on without any asking of their
own.&nbsp; This is a sin shared in more or less by all classes;
but there are sins which, like taxation, fall the heaviest on the
poorest, and none have such galling reasons as we working men to
try and rouse to the utmost the feeling of responsibility in
fathers and mothers.&nbsp; We have been urged into co-operation
by the pressure of common demands.&nbsp; In war men need each
other more; and where a given point has to be defended, fighters
inevitably find themselves shoulder to shoulder.&nbsp; So
fellowship grows, so grow the rules of fellowship, which
gradually shape themselves to thoroughness as the idea of a
common good becomes more complete.&nbsp; We feel a right to say,
If you will be one of us, you must make such and such a
contribution&mdash;you must renounce such and such a separate
advantage&mdash;you must set your face against such and such an
infringement.&nbsp; If we have any false ideas about our common
good, our rules will be wrong, and we shall be co-operating to
damage each other.&nbsp; But, now, here is a part of our good,
without which everything else we strive for will be
worthless&mdash;I mean the rescue of our children.&nbsp; Let us
demand from the members of our unions that they fulfil their duty
as parents in this definite matter, which rules can reach.&nbsp;
Let us demand that they send their children to school, so as not
to go on recklessly, breeding a moral pestilence among us, just
as strictly as we demand that they pay their contributions to a
common fund, understood to be for a common benefit.&nbsp; While
we watch our public men, let us watch one another as to this
duty, which is also public, and more momentous even than
obedience to sanitary regulations.&nbsp; While we resolutely
declare against the wickedness in high places, let us set
ourselves also against the wickedness in low places, not
quarrelling which came first, <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>or which is
the worse of the two&mdash;not trying to settle the miserable
precedence of plague or famine, but insisting unflinchingly on
remedies once ascertained, and summoning those who hold the
treasure of knowledge to remember that they hold it in trust, and
that with them lies the task of searching for new remedies, and
finding the right methods of applying them.</p>
<p>To find right remedies and right methods.&nbsp; Here is the
great function of knowledge: here the life of one man may make a
fresh era straight away, in which a sort of suffering that has
existed shall exist no more.&nbsp; For the thousands of years
down to the middle of the sixteenth century that human limbs had
been hacked and amputated, nobody knew how to stop the bleeding
except by searing the ends of the vessels with red-hot
iron.&nbsp; But then came a man named Ambrose Par&eacute;, and
said, &ldquo;Tie up the arteries!&rdquo;&nbsp; That was a fine
word to utter.&nbsp; It contained the statement of a
method&mdash;a plan by which a particular evil was forever
assuaged.&nbsp; Let us try to discern the men whose words carry
that sort of kernel, and choose such men to be our guides and
representatives&mdash;not choose platform swaggerers, who bring
us nothing but the ocean to make our broth with.</p>
<p>To get the chief power into the hands of the wisest, which
means to get our life regulated according to the truest
principles mankind is in possession of, is a problem as old as
the very notion of wisdom.&nbsp; The solution comes slowly,
because men collectively can only be made to embrace principles,
and to act on them, by the slow stupendous teaching of the
world&rsquo;s events.&nbsp; Men will go on planting potatoes, and
nothing else but potatoes, till a potato disease comes and forces
them to find out the advantage of a varied crop.&nbsp;
Selfishness, stupidity, sloth, persist in trying to adapt the
world to their desires, till a time comes when the world
manifests itself as too decidedly inconvenient to them.&nbsp;
Wisdom stands outside of man and urges itself upon him, like the
marks of the changing seasons, before it finds a home within him,
directs his actions, and from the precious effects of obedience
begets a corresponding love.</p>
<p>But while still outside of us, wisdom often looks terrible,
and wears strange forms, wrapped in the changing conditions of a
struggling world.&nbsp; It wears now the form of wants and just
demands in a great multitude of British men: wants and demands
urged into existence by the forces of a maturing world.&nbsp; And
it is in virtue of this&mdash;in virtue of this presence <!--
page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>of wisdom on our aide as a mighty fact, physical and
moral, which must enter into and shape the thoughts and actions
of mankind&mdash;that we working men have obtained the
suffrage.&nbsp; Not because we are an excellent multitude, but
because we are a needy multitude.</p>
<p>But now, for our own part, we have seriously to consider this
outside wisdom which lies in the supreme unalterable nature of
things, and watch to give it a home within us and obey it.&nbsp;
If the claims of the unendowed multitude of working men hold
within them principles which must shape the future, it is not
less true that the endowed classes, in their inheritance from the
past, hold the precious material without which no worthy, noble
future can be moulded.&nbsp; Many of the highest uses of life are
in their keeping; and if privilege has often been abused, it has
also been the nurse of excellence.&nbsp; Here again we have to
submit ourselves to the great law of inheritance.&nbsp; If we
quarrel with the way in which the labors and earnings of the past
have been preserved and handed down, we are just as bigoted, just
as narrow, just as wanting in that religion which keeps an open
ear and an obedient mind to the teachings of fact, as we accuse
those of being, who quarrel with the new truths and new needs
which are disclosed in the present.&nbsp; The deeper insight we
get into the causes of human trouble, and the ways by which men
are made better and happier, the less we shall be inclined to the
unprofitable spirit and practice of reproaching classes as such
in a wholesale fashion.&nbsp; Not all the evils of our condition
are such as we can justly blame others for; and, I repeat, many
of them are such as no changes of institutions can quickly
remedy.&nbsp; To discern between the evils that energy can remove
and the evils that patience must bear, makes the difference
between manliness and childishness, between good sense and
folly.&nbsp; And more than that, without such discernment, seeing
that we have grave duties toward our own body and the country at
large, we can hardly escape acts of fatal rashness and
injustice.</p>
<p>I am addressing a mixed assembly of workmen, and some of you
may be as well or better fitted than I am to take up this
office.&nbsp; But they will not think it amiss in me that I have
tried to bring together the considerations most likely to be of
service to us in preparing ourselves for the use of our new
opportunities.&nbsp; I have avoided touching on special
questions.&nbsp; The best help toward judging well on these is to
approach them in the right temper without vain expectation, and
with a resolution which is mixed with temperance.</p>

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
