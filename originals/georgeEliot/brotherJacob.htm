<h1>BROTHER JACOB</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Among the many fatalities attending the bloom of young desire, that
of blindly taking to the confectionery line has not, perhaps, been sufficiently
considered.&nbsp; How is the son of a British yeoman, who has been fed
principally on salt pork and yeast dumplings, to know that there is
satiety for the human stomach even in a paradise of glass jars full
of sugared almonds and pink lozenges, and that the tedium of life can
reach a pitch where plum-buns at discretion cease to offer the slightest
excitement?&nbsp; Or how, at the tender age when a confectioner seems
to him a very prince whom all the world must envy&mdash;who breakfasts
on macaroons, dines on meringues, sups on twelfth-cake, and fills up
the intermediate hours with sugar-candy or peppermint&mdash;how is he
to foresee the day of sad wisdom, when he will discern that the confectioner&rsquo;s
calling is not socially influential, or favourable to a soaring ambition?&nbsp;
I have known a man who turned out to have a metaphysical genius, incautiously,
in the period of youthful buoyancy, commence his career as a dancing-master;
and you may imagine the use that was made of this initial mistake by
opponents who felt themselves bound to warn the public against his doctrine
of the Inconceivable.&nbsp; He could not give up his dancing-lessons,
because he made his bread by them, and metaphysics would not have found
him in so much as salt to his bread.&nbsp; It was really the same with
Mr. David Faux and the confectionery business.&nbsp; His uncle, the
butler at the great house close by Brigford, had made a pet of him in
his early boyhood, and it was on a visit to this uncle that the confectioners&rsquo;
shops in that brilliant town had, on a single day, fired his tender
imagination.&nbsp; He carried home the pleasing illusion that a confectioner
must be at once the happiest and the foremost of men, since the things
he made were not only the most beautiful to behold, but the very best
eating, and such as the Lord Mayor must always order largely for his
private recreation; so that when his father declared he must be put
to a trade, David chose his line without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation;
and, with a rashness inspired by a sweet tooth, wedded himself irrevocably
to confectionery.&nbsp; Soon, however, the tooth lost its relish and
fell into blank indifference; and all the while, his mind expanded,
his ambition took new shapes, which could hardly be satisfied within
the sphere his youthful ardour had chosen.&nbsp; But what was he to
do?&nbsp; He was a young man of much mental activity, and, above all,
gifted with a spirit of contrivance; but then, his faculties would not
tell with great effect in any other medium than that of candied sugars,
conserves, and pastry.&nbsp; Say what you will about the identity of
the reasoning process in all branches of thought, or about the advantage
of coming to subjects with a fresh mind, the adjustment of butter to
flour, and of heat to pastry, is <i>not</i> the best preparation for
the office of prime minister; besides, in the present imperfectly-organized
state of society, there are social barriers.&nbsp; David could invent
delightful things in the way of drop-cakes, and he had the widest views
of the sugar department; but in other directions he certainly felt hampered
by the want of knowledge and practical skill; and the world is so inconveniently
constituted, that the vague consciousness of being a fine fellow is
no guarantee of success in any line of business.</p>
<p>This difficulty pressed with some severity on Mr. David Faux, even
before his apprenticeship was ended.&nbsp; His soul swelled with an
impatient sense that he ought to become something very remarkable&mdash;that
it was quite out of the question for him to put up with a narrow lot
as other men did: he scorned the idea that he could accept an average.&nbsp;
He was sure there was nothing average about him: even such a person
as Mrs. Tibbits, the washer-woman, perceived it, and probably had a
preference for his linen.&nbsp; At that particular period he was weighing
out gingerbread nuts; but such an anomaly could not continue.&nbsp;
No position could be suited to Mr. David Faux that was not in the highest
degree easy to the flesh and flattering to the spirit.&nbsp; If he had
fallen on the present times, and enjoyed the advantages of a Mechanic&rsquo;s
Institute, he would certainly have taken to literature and have written
reviews; but his education had not been liberal.&nbsp; He had read some
novels from the adjoining circulating library, and had even bought the
story of <i>Inkle and Yarico</i>, which had made him feel very sorry
for poor Mr. Inkle; so that his ideas might not have been below a certain
mark of the literary calling; but his spelling and diction were too
unconventional.</p>
<p>When a man is not adequately appreciated or comfortably placed in
his own country, his thoughts naturally turn towards foreign climes;
and David&rsquo;s imagination circled round and round the utmost limits
of his geographical knowledge, in search of a country where a young
gentleman of pasty visage, lipless mouth, and stumpy hair, would be
likely to be received with the hospitable enthusiasm which he had a
right to expect.&nbsp; Having a general idea of America as a country
where the population was chiefly black, it appeared to him the most
propitious destination for an emigrant who, to begin with, had the broad
and easily recognizable merit of whiteness; and this idea gradually
took such strong possession of him that Satan seized the opportunity
of suggesting to him that he might emigrate under easier circumstances,
if he supplied himself with a little money from his master&rsquo;s till.&nbsp;
But that evil spirit, whose understanding, I am convinced, has been
much overrated, quite wasted his time on this occasion.&nbsp; David
would certainly have liked well to have some of his master&rsquo;s money
in his pocket, if he had been sure his master would have been the only
man to suffer for it; but he was a cautious youth, and quite determined
to run no risks on his own account.&nbsp; So he stayed out his apprenticeship,
and committed no act of dishonesty that was at all likely to be discovered,
reserving his plan of emigration for a future opportunity.&nbsp; And
the circumstances under which he carried it out were in this wise.&nbsp;
Having been at home a week or two partaking of the family beans, he
had used his leisure in ascertaining a fact which was of considerable
importance to him, namely, that his mother had a small sum in guineas
painfully saved from her maiden perquisites, and kept in the corner
of a drawer where her baby-linen had reposed for the last twenty years&mdash;ever
since her son David had taken to his feet, with a slight promise of
bow-legs which had not been altogether unfulfilled.&nbsp; Mr. Faux,
senior, had told his son very frankly, that he must not look to being
set up in business by <i>him</i>: with seven sons, and one of them a
very healthy and well-developed idiot, who consumed a dumpling about
eight inches in diameter every day, it was pretty well if they got a
hundred apiece at his death.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, what was
David to do?&nbsp; It was certainly hard that he should take his mother&rsquo;s
money; but he saw no other ready means of getting any, and it was not
to be expected that a young man of his merit should put up with inconveniences
that could be avoided.&nbsp; Besides, it is not robbery to take property
belonging to your mother: she doesn&rsquo;t prosecute you.&nbsp; And
David was very well behaved to his mother; he comforted her by speaking
highly of himself to her, and assuring her that he never fell into the
vices he saw practised by other youths of his own age, and that he was
particularly fond of honesty.&nbsp; If his mother would have given him
her twenty guineas as a reward of this noble disposition, he really
would not have stolen them from her, and it would have been more agreeable
to his feelings.&nbsp; Nevertheless, to an active mind like David&rsquo;s,
ingenuity is not without its pleasures: it was rather an interesting
occupation to become stealthily acquainted with the wards of his mother&rsquo;s
simple key (not in the least like Chubb&rsquo;s patent), and to get
one that would do its work equally well; and also to arrange a little
drama by which he would escape suspicion, and run no risk of forfeiting
the prospective hundred at his father&rsquo;s death, which would be
convenient in the improbable case of his <i>not</i> making a large fortune
in the &ldquo;Indies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First, he spoke freely of his intention to start shortly for Liverpool
and take ship for America; a resolution which cost his good mother some
pain, for, after Jacob the idiot, there was not one of her sons to whom
her heart clung more than to her youngest-born, David.&nbsp; Next, it
appeared to him that Sunday afternoon, when everybody was gone to church
except Jacob and the cowboy, was so singularly favourable an opportunity
for sons who wanted to appropriate their mothers&rsquo; guineas, that
he half thought it must have been kindly intended by Providence for
such purposes.&nbsp; Especially the third Sunday in Lent; because Jacob
had been out on one of his occasional wanderings for the last two days;
and David, being a timid young man, had a considerable dread and hatred
of Jacob, as of a large personage who went about habitually with a pitchfork
in his hand.</p>
<p>Nothing could be easier, then, than for David on this Sunday afternoon
to decline going to church, on the ground that he was going to tea at
Mr. Lunn&rsquo;s, whose pretty daughter Sally had been an early flame
of his, and, when the church-goers were at a safe distance, to abstract
the guineas from their wooden box and slip them into a small canvas
bag&mdash;nothing easier than to call to the cowboy that he was going,
and tell him to keep an eye on the house for fear of Sunday tramps.&nbsp;
David thought it would be easy, too, to get to a small thicket and bury
his bag in a hole he had already made and covered up under the roots
of an old hollow ash, and he had, in fact, found the hole without a
moment&rsquo;s difficulty, had uncovered it, and was about gently to
drop the bag into it, when the sound of a large body rustling towards
him with something like a bellow was such a surprise to David, who,
as a gentleman gifted with much contrivance, was naturally only prepared
for what he expected, that instead of dropping the bag gently he let
it fall so as to make it untwist and vomit forth the shining guineas.&nbsp;
In the same moment he looked up and saw his dear brother Jacob close
upon him, holding the pitchfork so that the bright smooth prongs were
a yard in advance of his own body, and about a foot off David&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
(A learned friend, to whom I once narrated this history, observed that
it was David&rsquo;s guilt which made these prongs formidable, and that
the &ldquo;mens nil conscia sibi&rdquo; strips a pitchfork of all terrors.&nbsp;
I thought this idea so valuable, that I obtained his leave to use it
on condition of suppressing his name.)&nbsp; Nevertheless, David did
not entirely lose his presence of mind; for in that case he would have
sunk on the earth or started backward; whereas he kept his ground and
smiled at Jacob, who nodded his head up and down, and said, &ldquo;Hoich,
Zavy!&rdquo; in a painfully equivocal manner.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s heart
was beating audibly, and if he had had any lips they would have been
pale; but his mental activity, instead of being paralysed, was stimulated.&nbsp;
While he was inwardly praying (he always prayed when he was much frightened)&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
save me this once, and I&rsquo;ll never get into danger again!&rdquo;&mdash;he
was thrusting his hand into his pocket in search of a box of yellow
lozenges, which he had brought with him from Brigford among other delicacies
of the same portable kind, as a means of conciliating proud beauty,
and more particularly the beauty of Miss Sarah Lunn.&nbsp; Not one of
these delicacies had he ever offered to poor Jacob, for David was not
a young man to waste his jujubes and barley-sugar in giving pleasure
to people from whom he expected nothing.&nbsp; But an idiot with equivocal
intentions and a pitchfork is as well worth flattering and cajoling
as if he were Louis Napoleon.&nbsp; So David, with a promptitude equal
to the occasion, drew out his box of yellow lozenges, lifted the lid,
and performed a pantomime with his mouth and fingers, which was meant
to imply that he was delighted to see his dear brother Jacob, and seized
the opportunity of making him a small present, which he would find particularly
agreeable to the taste.&nbsp; Jacob, you understand, was not an intense
idiot, but within a certain limited range knew how to choose the good
and reject the evil: he took one lozenge, by way of test, and sucked
it as if he had been a philosopher; then, in as great an ecstacy at
its new and complex savour as Caliban at the taste of Trinculo&rsquo;s
wine, chuckled and stroked this suddenly beneficent brother, and held
out his hand for more; for, except in fits of anger, Jacob was not ferocious
or needlessly predatory.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s courage half returned,
and he left off praying; pouring a dozen lozenges into Jacob&rsquo;s
palm, and trying to look very fond of him.&nbsp; He congratulated himself
that he had formed the plan of going to see Miss Sally Lunn this afternoon,
and that, as a consequence, he had brought with him these propitiatory
delicacies: he was certainly a lucky fellow; indeed, it was always likely
Providence should be fonder of him than of other apprentices, and since
he <i>was</i> to be interrupted, why, an idiot was preferable to any
other sort of witness.&nbsp; For the first time in his life, David thought
he saw the advantage of idiots.</p>
<p>As for Jacob, he had thrust his pitchfork into the ground, and had
thrown himself down beside it, in thorough abandonment to the unprecedented
pleasure of having five lozenges in his mouth at once, blinking meanwhile,
and making inarticulate sounds of gustative content.&nbsp; He had not
yet given any sign of noticing the guineas, but in seating himself he
had laid his broad right hand on them, and unconsciously kept it in
that position, absorbed in the sensations of his palate.&nbsp; If he
could only be kept so occupied with the lozenges as not to see the guineas
before David could manage to cover them!&nbsp; That was David&rsquo;s
best hope of safety; for Jacob knew his mother&rsquo;s guineas; it had
been part of their common experience as boys to be allowed to look at
these handsome coins, and rattle them in their box on high days and
holidays, and among all Jacob&rsquo;s narrow experiences as to money,
this was likely to be the most memorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Jacob,&rdquo; said David, in an insinuating tone, handing
the box to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em all to you.&nbsp; Run!&mdash;make
haste!&mdash;else somebody&rsquo;ll come and take &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David, not having studied the psychology of idiots, was not aware
that they are not to be wrought upon by imaginative fears.&nbsp; Jacob
took the box with his left hand, but saw no necessity for running away.&nbsp;
Was ever a promising young man wishing to lay the foundation of his
fortune by appropriating his mother&rsquo;s guineas obstructed by such
a day-mare as this?&nbsp; But the moment must come when Jacob would
move his right hand to draw off the lid of the tin box, and then David
would sweep the guineas into the hole with the utmost address and swiftness,
and immediately seat himself upon them.&nbsp; Ah, no!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
of no use to have foresight when you are dealing with an idiot: he is
not to be calculated upon.&nbsp; Jacob&rsquo;s right hand was given
to vague clutching and throwing; it suddenly clutched the guineas as
if they had been so many pebbles, and was raised in an attitude which
promised to scatter them like seed over a distant bramble, when, from
some prompting or other&mdash;probably of an unwonted sensation&mdash;it
paused, descended to Jacob&rsquo;s knee, and opened slowly under the
inspection of Jacob&rsquo;s dull eyes.&nbsp; David began to pray again,
but immediately desisted&mdash;another resource having occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! zinnies!&rdquo; exclaimed the innocent Jacob.&nbsp;
Then, looking at David, he said, interrogatively, &ldquo;Box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; said David, summoning all his ingenuity
in this severe strait.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, Jacob!&rdquo;&nbsp; He took
the tin box from his brother&rsquo;s hand, and emptied it of the lozenges,
returning half of them to Jacob, but secretly keeping the rest in his
own hand.&nbsp; Then he held out the empty box, and said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the box, Jacob!&nbsp; The box for the guineas!&rdquo; gently sweeping
them from Jacob&rsquo;s palm into the box.</p>
<p>This procedure was not objectionable to Jacob; on the contrary, the
guineas clinked so pleasantly as they fell, that he wished for a repetition
of the sound, and seizing the box, began to rattle it very gleefully.&nbsp;
David, seizing the opportunity, deposited his reserve of lozenges in
the ground and hastily swept some earth over them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look,
Jacob!&rdquo; he said, at last.&nbsp; Jacob paused from his clinking,
and looked into the hole, while David began to scratch away the earth,
as if in doubtful expectation.&nbsp; When the lozenges were laid bare,
he took them out one by one, and gave them to Jacob.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
he said, in a loud whisper, &ldquo;Tell nobody&mdash;all for Jacob&mdash;hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&nbsp;
Put guineas in the hole&mdash;they&rsquo;ll come out like this!&rdquo;&nbsp;
To make the lesson more complete, he took a guinea, and lowering it
into the hole, said, &ldquo;Put in <i>so</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, as
he took the last lozenge out, he said, &ldquo;Come out <i>so</i>,&rdquo;
and put the lozenge into Jacob&rsquo;s hospitable mouth.</p>
<p>Jacob turned his head on one side, looked first at his brother and
then at the hole, like a reflective monkey, and, finally, laid the box
of guineas in the hole with much decision.&nbsp; David made haste to
add every one of the stray coins, put on the lid, and covered it well
with earth, saying in his meet coaxing tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;m out to-morrow, Jacob; all for Jacob!&nbsp; Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob, to whom this once indifferent brother had all at once become
a sort of sweet-tasted fetish, stroked David&rsquo;s best coat with
his adhesive fingers, and then hugged him with an accompaniment of that
mingled chuckling and gurgling by which he was accustomed to express
the milder passions.&nbsp; But if he had chosen to bite a small morsel
out of his beneficent brother&rsquo;s cheek, David would have been obliged
to bear it.</p>
<p>And here I must pause, to point out to you the short-sightedness
of human contrivance.&nbsp; This ingenious young man, Mr. David Faux,
thought he had achieved a triumph of cunning when he had associated
himself in his brother&rsquo;s rudimentary mind with the flavour of
yellow lozenges.&nbsp; But he had yet to learn that it is a dreadful
thing to make an idiot fond of you, when you yourself are not of an
affectionate disposition: especially an idiot with a pitchfork&mdash;obviously
a difficult friend to shake off by rough usage.</p>
<p>It may seem to you rather a blundering contrivance for a clever young
man to bury the guineas.&nbsp; But, if everything had turned out as
David had calculated, you would have seen that his plan was worthy of
his talents.&nbsp; The guineas would have lain safely in the earth while
the theft was discovered, and David, with the calm of conscious innocence,
would have lingered at home, reluctant to say good-bye to his dear mother
while she was in grief about her guineas; till at length, on the eve
of his departure, he would have disinterred them in the strictest privacy,
and carried them on his own person without inconvenience.&nbsp; But
David, you perceive, had reckoned without his host, or, to speak more
precisely, without his idiot brother&mdash;an item of so uncertain and
fluctuating a character, that I doubt whether he would not have puzzled
the astute heroes of M. de Balzac, whose foresight is so remarkably
at home in the future.</p>
<p>It was clear to David now that he had only one alternative before
him: he must either renounce the guineas, by quietly putting them back
in his mother&rsquo;s drawer (a course not unattended with difficulty);
or he must leave more than a suspicion behind him, by departing early
the next morning without giving notice, and with the guineas in his
pocket.&nbsp; For if he gave notice that he was going, his mother, he
knew, would insist on fetching from her box of guineas the three she
had always promised him as his share; indeed, in his original plan,
he had counted on this as a means by which the theft would be discovered
under circumstances that would themselves speak for his innocence; but
now, as I need hardly explain, that well-combined plan was completely
frustrated.&nbsp; Even if David could have bribed Jacob with perpetual
lozenges, an idiot&rsquo;s secrecy is itself betrayal.&nbsp; He dared
not even go to tea at Mr. Lunn&rsquo;s, for in that case he would have
lost sight of Jacob, who, in his impatience for the crop of lozenges,
might scratch up the box again while he was absent, and carry it home&mdash;depriving
him at once of reputation and guineas.&nbsp; No! he must think of nothing
all the rest of this day, but of coaxing Jacob and keeping him out of
mischief.&nbsp; It was a fatiguing and anxious evening to David; nevertheless,
he dared not go to sleep without tying a piece of string to his thumb
and great toe, to secure his frequent waking; for he meant to be up
with the first peep of dawn, and be far out of reach before breakfast-time.&nbsp;
His father, he thought, would certainly cut him off with a shilling;
but what then?&nbsp; Such a striking young man as he would be sure to
be well received in the West Indies: in foreign countries there are
always openings&mdash;even for cats.&nbsp; It was probable that some
Princess Yarico would want him to marry her, and make him presents of
very large jewels beforehand; after which, he needn&rsquo;t marry her
unless he liked.&nbsp; David had made up his mind not to steal any more,
even from people who were fond of him: it was an unpleasant way of making
your fortune in a world where you were likely to surprised in the act
by brothers.&nbsp; Such alarms did not agree with David&rsquo;s constitution,
and he had felt so much nausea this evening that no doubt his liver
was affected.&nbsp; Besides, he would have been greatly hurt not to
be thought well of in the world: he always meant to make a figure, and
be thought worthy of the best seats and the best morsels.</p>
<p>Ruminating to this effect on the brilliant future in reserve for
him, David by the help of his check-string kept himself on the alert
to seize the time of earliest dawn for his rising and departure.&nbsp;
His brothers, of course, were early risers, but he should anticipate
them by at least an hour and a half, and the little room which he had
to himself as only an occasional visitor, had its window over the horse-block,
so that he could slip out through the window without the least difficulty.&nbsp;
Jacob, the horrible Jacob, had an awkward trick of getting up before
everybody else, to stem his hunger by emptying the milk-bowl that was
&ldquo;duly set&rdquo; for him; but of late he had taken to sleeping
in the hay-loft, and if he came into the house, it would be on the opposite
side to that from which David was making his exit.&nbsp; There was no
need to think of Jacob; yet David was liberal enough to bestow a curse
on him&mdash;it was the only thing he ever did bestow gratuitously.&nbsp;
His small bundle of clothes was ready packed, and he was soon treading
lightly on the steps of the horse-block, soon walking at a smart pace
across the fields towards the thicket.&nbsp; It would take him no more
than two minutes to get out the box; he could make out the tree it was
under by the pale strip where the bark was off, although the dawning
light was rather dimmer in the thicket.&nbsp; But what, in the name
of&mdash;burnt pastry&mdash;was that large body with a staff planted
beside it, close at the foot of the ash-tree?&nbsp; David paused, not
to make up his mind as to the nature of the apparition&mdash;he had
not the happiness of doubting for a moment that the staff was Jacob&rsquo;s
pitchfork&mdash;but to gather the self-command necessary for addressing
his brother with a sufficiently honeyed accent.&nbsp; Jacob was absorbed
in scratching up the earth, and had not heard David&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jacob,&rdquo; said David in a loud whisper, just as
the tin box was lifted out of the hole.</p>
<p>Jacob looked up, and discerning his sweet-flavoured brother, nodded
and grinned in the dim light in a way that made him seem to David like
a triumphant demon.&nbsp; If he had been of an impetuous disposition,
he would have snatched the pitchfork from the ground and impaled this
fraternal demon.&nbsp; But David was by no means impetuous; he was a
young man greatly given to calculate consequences, a habit which has
been held to be the foundation of virtue.&nbsp; But somehow it had not
precisely that effect in David: he calculated whether an action would
harm himself, or whether it would only harm other people.&nbsp; In the
former case he was very timid about satisfying his immediate desires,
but in the latter he would risk the result with much courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me, Jacob,&rdquo; he said, stooping down and patting
his brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob, finding the lid rather tight, gave the box to his brother
in perfect faith.&nbsp; David raised the lids and shook his head, while
Jacob put his finger in and took out a guinea to taste whether the metamorphosis
into lozenges was complete and satisfactory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jacob; too soon, too soon,&rdquo; said David, when the
guinea had been tasted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give it me; we&rsquo;ll go and
bury it somewhere else; we&rsquo;ll put it in yonder,&rdquo; he added,
pointing vaguely toward the distance.</p>
<p>David screwed on the lid, while Jacob, looking grave, rose and grasped
his pitchfork.&nbsp; Then, seeing David&rsquo;s bundle, he snatched
it, like a too officious Newfoundland, stuck his pitchfork into it and
carried it over his shoulder in triumph as he accompanied David and
the box out of the thicket.</p>
<p>What on earth was David to do?&nbsp; It would have been easy to frown
at Jacob, and kick him, and order him to get away; but David dared as
soon have kicked the bull.&nbsp; Jacob was quiet as long as he was treated
indulgently; but on the slightest show of anger, he became unmanageable,
and was liable to fits of fury which would have made him formidable
even without his pitchfork.&nbsp; There was no mastery to be obtained
over him except by kindness or guile.&nbsp; David tried guile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Jacob,&rdquo; he said, when they were out of the thicket&mdash;pointing
towards the house as he spoke; &ldquo;go and fetch me a spade&mdash;a
spade.&nbsp; But give <i>me</i> the bundle,&rdquo; he added, trying
to reach it from the fork, where it hung high above Jacob&rsquo;s tall
shoulder.</p>
<p>But Jacob showed as much alacrity in obeying as a wasp shows in leaving
a sugar-basin.&nbsp; Near David, he felt himself in the vicinity of
lozenges: he chuckled and rubbed his brother&rsquo;s back, brandishing
the bundle higher out of reach.&nbsp; David, with an inward groan, changed
his tactics, and walked on as fast as he could.&nbsp; It was not safe
to linger.&nbsp; Jacob would get tired of following him, or, at all
events, could be eluded.&nbsp; If they could once get to the distant
highroad, a coach would overtake them, David would mount it, having
previously by some ingenious means secured his bundle, and then Jacob
might howl and flourish his pitchfork as much as he liked.&nbsp; Meanwhile
he was under the fatal necessity of being very kind to this ogre, and
of providing a large breakfast for him when they stopped at a roadside
inn.&nbsp; It was already three hours since they had started, and David
was tired.&nbsp; Would no coach be coming up soon? he inquired.&nbsp;
No coach for the next two hours.&nbsp; But there was a carrier&rsquo;s
cart to come immediately, on its way to the next town.&nbsp; If he could
slip out, even leaving his bundle behind, and get into the cart without
Jacob!&nbsp; But there was a new obstacle.&nbsp; Jacob had recently
discovered a remnant of sugar-candy in one of his brother&rsquo;s tail-pockets;
and, since then, had cautiously kept his hold on that limb of the garment,
perhaps with an expectation that there would be a further development
of sugar-candy after a longer or shorter interval.&nbsp; Now every one
who has worn a coat will understand the sensibilities that must keep
a man from starting away in a hurry when there is a grasp on his coat-tail.&nbsp;
David looked forward to being well received among strangers, but it
might make a difference if he had only one tail to his coat.</p>
<p>He felt himself in a cold perspiration.&nbsp; He could walk no more:
he must get into the cart and let Jacob get in with him.&nbsp; Presently
a cheering idea occurred to him: after so large a breakfast, Jacob would
be sure to go to sleep in the cart; you see at once that David meant
to seize his bundle, jump out, and be free.&nbsp; His expectation was
partly fulfilled: Jacob did go to sleep in the cart, but it was in a
peculiar attitude&mdash;it was with his arms tightly fastened round
his dear brother&rsquo;s body; and if ever David attempted to move,
the grasp tightened with the force of an affectionate boa-constrictor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; innicent&rsquo;s fond on you,&rdquo; observed the
carrier, thinking that David was probably an amiable brother, and wishing
to pay him a compliment.</p>
<p>David groaned.&nbsp; The ways of thieving were not ways of pleasantness.&nbsp;
Oh, why had he an idiot brother?&nbsp; Oh, why, in general, was the
world so constituted that a man could not take his mother&rsquo;s guineas
comfortably?&nbsp; David became grimly speculative.</p>
<p>Copious dinner at noon for Jacob; but little dinner, because little
appetite, for David.&nbsp; Instead of eating, he plied Jacob with beer;
for through this liberality he descried a hope.&nbsp; Jacob fell into
a dead sleep, at last, without having his arms round David, who paid
the reckoning, took his bundle, and walked off.&nbsp; In another half-hour
he was on the coach on his way to Liverpool, smiling the smile of the
triumphant wicked.&nbsp; He was rid of Jacob&mdash;he was bound for
the Indies, where a gullible princess awaited him.&nbsp; He would never
steal any more, but there would be no need; he would show himself so
deserving, that people would make him presents freely.&nbsp; He must
give up the notion of his father&rsquo;s legacy; but it was not likely
he would ever want that trifle; and even if he did&mdash;why, it was
a compensation to think that in being for ever divided from his family
he was divided from Jacob, more terrible than Gorgon or Demogorgon to
David&rsquo;s timid green eyes.&nbsp; Thank heaven, he should never
see Jacob any more!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>It was nearly six years after the departure of Mr. David Faux for
the West Indies, that the vacant shop in the market-place at Grimworth
was understood to have been let to the stranger with a sallow complexion
and a buff cravat, whose first appearance had caused some excitement
in the bar of the Woolpack, where he had called to wait for the coach.</p>
<p>Grimworth, to a discerning eye, was a good place to set up shopkeeping
in.&nbsp; There was no competition in it at present; the Church-people
had their own grocer and draper; the Dissenters had theirs; and the
two or three butchers found a ready market for their joints without
strict reference to religious persuasion&mdash;except that the rector&rsquo;s
wife had given a general order for the veal sweet-breads and the mutton
kidneys, while Mr. Rodd, the Baptist minister, had requested that, so
far as was compatible with the fair accommodation of other customers,
the sheep&rsquo;s trotters might be reserved for him.&nbsp; And it was
likely to be a growing place, for the trustees of Mr. Zephaniah Crypt&rsquo;s
Charity, under the stimulus of a late visitation by commissioners, were
beginning to apply long-accumulating funds to the rebuilding of the
Yellow Coat School, which was henceforth to be carried forward on a
greatly-extended scale, the testator having left no restrictions concerning
the curriculum, but only concerning the coat.</p>
<p>The shopkeepers at Grimworth were by no means unanimous as to the
advantages promised by this prospect of increased population and trading,
being substantial men, who liked doing a quiet business in which they
were sure of their customers, and could calculate their returns to a
nicety.&nbsp; Hitherto, it had been held a point of honour by the families
in Grimworth parish, to buy their sugar and their flannel at the shop
where their fathers and mothers had bought before them; but, if newcomers
were to bring in the system of neck-and-neck trading, and solicit feminine
eyes by gown-pieces laid in fan-like folds, and surmounted by artificial
flowers, giving them a factitious charm (for on what human figure would
a gown sit like a fan, or what female head was like a bunch of China-asters?),
or, if new grocers were to fill their windows with mountains of currants
and sugar, made seductive by contrast and tickets,&mdash;what security
was there for Grimworth, that a vagrant spirit in shopping, once introduced,
would not in the end carry the most important families to the larger
market town of Cattleton, where, business being done on a system of
small profits and quick returns, the fashions were of the freshest,
and goods of all kinds might be bought at an advantage?</p>
<p>With this view of the times predominant among the tradespeople at
Grimworth, their uncertainty concerning the nature of the business which
the sallow-complexioned stranger was about to set up in the vacant shop,
naturally gave some additional strength to the fears of the less sanguine.&nbsp;
If he was going to sell drapery, it was probable that a pale-faced fellow
like that would deal in showy and inferior articles&mdash;printed cottons
and muslins which would leave their dye in the wash-tub, jobbed linen
full of knots, and flannel that would soon look like gauze.&nbsp; If
grocery, then it was to be hoped that no mother of a family would trust
the teas of an untried grocer.&nbsp; Such things had been known in some
parishes as tradesmen going about canvassing for custom with cards in
their pockets: when people came from nobody knew where, there was no
knowing what they might do.&nbsp; It was a thousand pities that Mr.
Moffat, the auctioneer and broker, had died without leaving anybody
to follow him in the business, and Mrs. Cleve&rsquo;s trustee ought
to have known better than to let a shop to a stranger.&nbsp; Even the
discovery that ovens were being put up on the premises, and that the
shop was, in fact, being fitted up for a confectioner and pastry-cook&rsquo;s
business, hitherto unknown in Grimworth, did not quite suffice to turn
the scale in the newcomer&rsquo;s favour, though the landlady at the
Woolpack defended him warmly, said he seemed to be a very clever young
man, and from what she could make out, came of a very good family; indeed,
was most likely a good many people&rsquo;s betters.</p>
<p>It certainly made a blaze of light and colour, almost as if a rainbow
had suddenly descended into the market-place, when, one fine morning,
the shutters were taken down from the new shop, and the two windows
displayed their decorations.&nbsp; On one side, there were the variegated
tints of collared and marbled meats, set off by bright green leaves,
the pale brown of glazed pies, the rich tones of sauces and bottled
fruits enclosed in their veil of glass&mdash;altogether a sight to bring
tears into the eyes of a Dutch painter; and on the other, there was
a predominance of the more delicate hues of pink, and white, and yellow,
and buff, in the abundant lozenges, candies, sweet biscuits and icings,
which to the eyes of a bilious person might easily have been blended
into a fa&euml;ry landscape in Turner&rsquo;s latest style.&nbsp; What
a sight to dawn upon the eyes of Grimworth children!&nbsp; They almost
forgot to go to their dinner that day, their appetites being preoccupied
with imaginary sugar-plums; and I think even Punch, setting up his tabernacle
in the market-place, would not have succeeded in drawing them away from
those shop-windows, where they stood according to gradations of size
and strength, the biggest and strongest being nearest the window, and
the little ones in the outermost rows lifting wide-open eyes and mouths
towards the upper tier of jars, like small birds at meal-time.</p>
<p>The elder inhabitants pished and pshawed a little at the folly of
the new shopkeeper in venturing on such an outlay in goods that would
not keep; to be sure, Christmas was coming, but what housewife in Grimworth
would not think shame to furnish forth her table with articles that
were not home-cooked?&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Freely, as he called
himself, was deceived, if he thought Grimworth money was to flow into
his pockets on such terms.</p>
<p>Edward Freely was the name that shone in gilt letters on a mazarine
ground over the doorplace of the new shop&mdash;a generous-sounding
name, that might have belonged to the open-hearted, improvident hero
of an old comedy, who would have delighted in raining sugared almonds,
like a new manna-gift, among that small generation outside the windows.&nbsp;
But Mr. Edward Freely was a man whose impulses were kept in due subordination:
he held that the desire for sweets and pastry must only be satisfied
in a direct ratio with the power of paying for them.&nbsp; If the smallest
child in Grimworth would go to him with a halfpenny in its tiny fist,
he would, after ringing the halfpenny, deliver a just equivalent in
&ldquo;rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not a man to cheat even the smallest
child&mdash;he often said so, observing at the same time that he loved
honesty, and also that he was very tender-hearted, though he didn&rsquo;t
show his feelings as some people did.</p>
<p>Either in reward of such virtue, or according to some more hidden
law of sequence, Mr. Freely&rsquo;s business, in spite of prejudice,
started under favourable auspices.&nbsp; For Mrs. Chaloner, the rector&rsquo;s
wife, was among the earliest customers at the shop, thinking it only
right to encourage a new parishioner who had made a decorous appearance
at church; and she found Mr. Freely a most civil, obliging young man,
and intelligent to a surprising degree for a confectioner; well-principled,
too, for in giving her useful hints about choosing sugars he had thrown
much light on the dishonesty of other tradesmen.&nbsp; Moreover, he
had been in the West Indies, and had seen the very estate which had
been her poor grandfather&rsquo;s property; and he said the missionaries
were the only cause of the negro&rsquo;s discontent&mdash;an observing
young man, evidently.&nbsp; Mrs. Chaloner ordered wine-biscuits and
olives, and gave Mr. Freely to understand that she should find his shop
a great convenience.&nbsp; So did the doctor&rsquo;s wife, and so did
Mrs. Gate, at the large carding-mill, who, having high connexions frequently
visiting her, might be expected to have a large consumption of ratafias
and macaroons.</p>
<p>The less aristocratic matrons of Grimworth seemed likely at first
to justify their husbands&rsquo; confidence that they would never pay
a percentage of profits on drop-cakes, instead of making their own,
or get up a hollow show of liberal housekeeping by purchasing slices
of collared meat when a neighbour came in for supper.&nbsp; But it is
my task to narrate the gradual corruption of Grimworth manners from
their primitive simplicity&mdash;a melancholy task, if it were not cheered
by the prospect of the fine peripateia or downfall by which the progress
of the corruption was ultimately checked.</p>
<p>It was young Mrs. Steene, the veterinary surgeons wife, who first
gave way to temptation.&nbsp; I fear she had been rather over-educated
for her station in life, for she knew by heart many passages in <i>Lalla
Rookh</i>, the <i>Corsair</i>, and the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>, which
had given her a distaste for domestic occupations, and caused her a
withering disappointment at the discovery that Mr. Steene, since his
marriage, had lost all interest in the &ldquo;bulbul,&rdquo; openly
preferred discussing the nature of spavin with a coarse neighbour, and
was angry if the pudding turned out watery&mdash;indeed, was simply
a top-booted &ldquo;vet.&rdquo;, who came in hungry at dinner-time;
and not in the least like a nobleman turned Corsair out of pure scorn
for his race, or like a renegade with a turban and crescent, unless
it were in the irritability of his temper.&nbsp; And scorn is such a
very different thing in top-boots!</p>
<p>This brutal man had invited a supper-party for Christmas eve, when
he would expect to see mince-pies on the table.&nbsp; Mrs. Steene had
prepared her mince-meat, and had devoted much butter, fine flour, and
labour, to the making of a batch of pies in the morning; but they proved
to be so very heavy when they came out of the oven, that she could only
think with trembling of the moment when her husband should catch sight
of them on the supper-table.&nbsp; He would storm at her, she was certain;
and before all the company; and then she should never help crying: it
was so dreadful to think she had come to that, after the bulbul and
everything!&nbsp; Suddenly the thought darted through her mind that
<i>this once</i> she might send for a dish of mince-pies from Freely&rsquo;s:
she knew he had some.&nbsp; But what was to become of the eighteen heavy
mince-pies?&nbsp; Oh, it was of no use thinking about that; it was very
expensive&mdash;indeed, making mince-pies at all was a great expense,
when they were not sure to turn out well: it would be much better to
buy them ready-made.&nbsp; You paid a little more for them, but there
was no risk of waste.</p>
<p>Such was the sophistry with which this misguided young woman&mdash;enough.&nbsp;
Mrs. Steene sent for the mince-pies, and, I am grieved to add, garbled
her household accounts in order to conceal the fact from her husband.&nbsp;
This was the second step in a downward course, all owing to a young
woman&rsquo;s being out of harmony with her circumstances, yearning
after renegades and bulbuls, and being subject to claims from a veterinary
surgeon fond of mince-pies.&nbsp; The third step was to harden herself
by telling the fact of the bought mince-pies to her intimate friend
Mrs. Mole, who had already guessed it, and who subsequently encouraged
herself in buying a mould of jelly, instead of exerting her own skill,
by the reflection that &ldquo;other people&rdquo; did the same sort
of thing.&nbsp; The infection spread; soon there was a party or clique
in Grimworth on the side of &ldquo;buying at Freely&rsquo;s&rdquo;;
and many husbands, kept for some time in the dark on this point, innocently
swallowed at two mouthfuls a tart on which they were paying a profit
of a hundred per cent., and as innocently encouraged a fatal disingenuousness
in the partners of their bosoms by praising the pastry.&nbsp; Others,
more keen-sighted, winked at the too frequent presentation on washing-days,
and at impromptu suppers, of superior spiced-beef, which flattered their
palates more than the cold remnants they had formerly been contented
with.&nbsp; Every housewife who had once &ldquo;bought at Freely&rsquo;s&rdquo;
felt a secret joy when she detected a similar perversion in her neighbour&rsquo;s
practice, and soon only two or three old-fashioned mistresses of families
held out in the protest against the growing demoralization, saying to
their neighbours who came to sup with them, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t offer
you Freely&rsquo;s beef, or Freely&rsquo;s cheesecakes; everything in
our house is home-made; I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll hardly have any
appetite for our plain pastry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor, whose cook was
not satisfactory, the curate, who kept no cook, and the mining agent,
who was a great <i>bon vivant</i>, even began to rely on Freely for
the greater part of their dinner, when they wished to give an entertainment
of some brilliancy.&nbsp; In short, the business of manufacturing the
more fanciful viands was fast passing out of the hinds of maids and
matrons in private families, and was becoming the work of a special
commercial organ.</p>
<p>I am not ignorant that this sort of thing is called the inevitable
course of civilization, division of labour, and so forth, and that the
maids and matrons may be said to have had their hands set free from
cookery to add to the wealth of society in some other way.&nbsp; Only
it happened at Grimworth, which, to be sure, was a low place, that the
maids and matrons could do nothing with their hands at all better than
cooking: not even those who had always made heavy cakes and leathery
pastry.&nbsp; And so it came to pass, that the progress of civilization
at Grimworth was not otherwise apparent than in the impoverishment of
men, the gossiping idleness of women, and the heightening prosperity
of Mr. Edward Freely.</p>
<p>The Yellow Coat School was a double source of profit to the calculating
confectioner; for he opened an eating-room for the superior workmen
employed on the new school, and he accommodated the pupils at the old
school by giving great attention to the fancy-sugar department.&nbsp;
When I think of the sweet-tasted swans and other ingenious white shapes
crunched by the small teeth of that rising generation, I am glad to
remember that a certain amount of calcareous food has been held good
for young creatures whose bones are not quite formed; for I have observed
these delicacies to have an inorganic flavour which would have recommended
them greatly to that young lady of the <i>Spectator&rsquo;s</i> acquaintance
who habitually made her dessert on the stems of tobacco-pipes.</p>
<p>As for the confectioner himself, he made his way gradually into Grimworth
homes, as his commodities did, in spite of some initial repugnance.&nbsp;
Somehow or other, his reception as a guest seemed a thing that required
justifying, like the purchasing of his pastry.&nbsp; In the first place,
he was a stranger, and therefore open to suspicion; secondly, the confectionery
business was so entirely new at Grimworth, that its place in the scale
of rank had not been distinctly ascertained.&nbsp; There was no doubt
about drapers and grocers, when they came of good old Grimworth families,
like Mr. Luff and Mr. Prettyman: they visited with the Palfreys, who
farmed their own land, played many a game at whist with the doctor,
and condescended a little towards the timber-merchant, who had lately
taken to the coal-trade also, and had got new furniture; but whether
a confectioner should be admitted to this higher level of respectability,
or should be understood to find his associates among butchers and bakers,
was a new question on which tradition threw no light.&nbsp; His being
a bachelor was in his favour, and would perhaps have been enough to
turn the scale, even if Mr. Edward Freely&rsquo;s other personal pretensions
had been of an entirely insignificant cast.&nbsp; But so far from this,
it very soon appeared that he was a remarkable young man, who had been
in the West Indies, and had seen many wonders by sea and land, so that
he could charm the ears of Grimworth Desdemonas with stories of strange
fishes, especially sharks, which he had stabbed in the nick of time
by bravely plunging overboard just as the monster was turning on his
side to devour the cook&rsquo;s mate; of terrible fevers which he had
undergone in a land where the wind blows from all quarters at once;
of rounds of toast cut straight from the breadfruit trees; of toes bitten
off by land-crabs; of large honours that had been offered to him as
a man who knew what was what, and was therefore particularly needed
in a tropical climate; and of a Creole heiress who had wept bitterly
at his departure.&nbsp; Such conversational talents as these, we know,
will overcome disadvantages of complexion; and young Towers, whose cheeks
were of the finest pink, set off by a fringe of dark whisker, was quite
eclipsed by the presence of the sallow Mr. Freely.&nbsp; So exceptional
a confectioner elevated the business, and might well begin to make disengaged
hearts flutter a little.</p>
<p>Fathers and mothers were naturally more slow and cautious in their
recognition of the newcomer&rsquo;s merits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an amusing fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Prettyman, the
highly respectable grocer.&nbsp; (Mrs. Prettyman was a Miss Fothergill,
and her sister had married a London mercer.)&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
an amusing fellow; and I&rsquo;ve no objection to his making one at
the Oyster Club; but he&rsquo;s a bit too fond of riding the high horse.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s uncommonly knowing, I&rsquo;ll allow; but how came he to
go to the Indies?&nbsp; I should like that answered.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
unnatural in a confectioner.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not fond of people that
have been beyond seas, if they can&rsquo;t give a good account how they
happened to go.&nbsp; When folks go so far off, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve
got little credit nearer home&mdash;that&rsquo;s my opinion.&nbsp; However,
he&rsquo;s got some good rum; but I don&rsquo;t want to be hand and
glove with him, for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this kind of dim suspicion which beclouded the view of Mr.
Freely&rsquo;s qualities in the maturer minds of Grimworth through the
early months of his residence there.&nbsp; But when the confectioner
ceased to be a novelty, the suspicions also ceased to be novel, and
people got tired of hinting at them, especially as they seemed to be
refuted by his advancing prosperity and importance.&nbsp; Mr. Freely
was becoming a person of influence in the parish; he was found useful
as an overseer of the poor, having great firmness in enduring other
people&rsquo;s pain, which firmness, he said, was due to his great benevolence;
he always did what was good for people in the end.&nbsp; Mr. Chaloner
had even selected him as clergyman&rsquo;s churchwarden, for he was
a very handy man, and much more of Mr. Chaloner&rsquo;s opinion in everything
about church business than the older parishioners.&nbsp; Mr. Freely
was a very regular churchman, but at the Oyster Club he was sometimes
a little free in his conversation, more than hinting at a life of Sultanic
self-indulgence which he had passed in the West Indies, shaking his
head now and then and smiling rather bitterly, as men are wont to do
when they intimate that they have become a little too wise to be instructed
about a world which has long been flat and stale to them.</p>
<p>For some time he was quite general in his attentions to the fair
sex, combining the gallantries of a lady&rsquo;s man with a severity
of criticism on the person and manners of absent belles, which tended
rather to stimulate in the feminine breast the desire to conquer the
approval of so fastidious a judge.&nbsp; Nothing short of the very best
in the department of female charms and virtues could suffice to kindle
the ardour of Mr. Edward Freely, who had become familiar with the most
luxuriant and dazzling beauty in the West Indies.&nbsp; It may seem
incredible that a confectioner should have ideas and conversation so
much resembling those to be met with in a higher walk of life, but it
must be remembered that he had not merely travelled, he had also bow-legs
and a sallow, small-featured visage, so that nature herself had stamped
him for a fastidious connoisseur of the fair sex.</p>
<p>At last, however, it seemed clear that Cupid had found a sharper
arrow than usual, and that Mr. Freely&rsquo;s heart was pierced.&nbsp;
It was the general talk among the young people at Grimworth.&nbsp; But
was it really love, and not rather ambition?&nbsp; Miss Fullilove, the
timber-merchant&rsquo;s daughter, was quite sure that if <i>she</i>
were Miss Penny Palfrey, she would be cautious; it was not a good sign
when men looked so much above themselves for a wife.&nbsp; For it was
no less a person than Miss Penelope Palfrey, second daughter of the
Mr. Palfrey who farmed his own land, that had attracted Mr. Freely&rsquo;s
peculiar regard, and conquered his fastidiousness; and no wonder, for
the Ideal, as exhibited in the finest waxwork, was perhaps never so
closely approached by the Real as in the person of the pretty Penelope.&nbsp;
Her yellowish flaxen hair did not curl naturally, I admit, but its bright
crisp ringlets were such smooth, perfect miniature tubes, that you would
have longed to pass your little finger through them, and feel their
soft elasticity.&nbsp; She wore them in a crop, for in those days, when
society was in a healthier state, young ladies wore crops long after
they were twenty, and Penelope was not yet nineteen.&nbsp; Like the
waxen ideal, she had round blue eyes, and round nostrils in her little
nose, and teeth such as the ideal would be seen to have, if it ever
showed them.&nbsp; Altogether, she was a small, round thing, as neat
as a pink and white double daisy, and as guileless; for I hope it does
not argue guile in a pretty damsel of nineteen, to think that she should
like to have a beau and be &ldquo;engaged,&rdquo; when her elder sister
had already been in that position a year and a half.&nbsp; To be sure,
there was young Towers always coming to the house; but Penny felt convinced
he only came to see her brother, for he never had anything to say to
her, and never offered her his arm, and was as awkward and silent as
possible.</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that Mr. Freely had early been smitten by Penny&rsquo;s
charms, as brought under his observation at church, but he had to make
his way in society a little before he could come into nearer contact
with them; and even after he was well received in Grimworth families,
it was a long while before he could converse with Penny otherwise than
in an incidental meeting at Mr. Luff&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was not so easy
to get invited to Long Meadows, the residence of the Palfreys; for though
Mr. Palfrey had been losing money of late years, not being able quite
to recover his feet after the terrible murrain which forced him to borrow,
his family were far from considering themselves on the same level even
as the old-established tradespeople with whom they visited.&nbsp; The
greatest people, even kings and queens, must visit with somebody, and
the equals of the great are scarce.&nbsp; They were especially scarce
at Grimworth, which, as I have before observed, was a low parish, mentioned
with the most scornful brevity in gazetteers.&nbsp; Even the great people
there were far behind those of their own standing in other parts of
this realm.&nbsp; Mr. Palfrey&rsquo;s farmyard doors had the paint all
worn off them, and the front garden walks had long been merged in a
general weediness.&nbsp; Still, his father had been called Squire Palfrey,
and had been respected by the last Grimworth generation as a man who
could afford to drink too much in his own house.</p>
<p>Pretty Penny was not blind to the fact that Mr. Freely admired her,
and she felt sure that it was he who had sent her a beautiful valentine;
but her sister seemed to think so lightly of him (all young ladies think
lightly of the gentlemen to whom they are not engaged), that Penny never
dared mention him, and trembled and blushed whenever they met him, thinking
of the valentine, which was very strong in its expressions, and which
she felt guilty of knowing by heart.&nbsp; A man who had been to the
Indies, and knew the sea so well, seemed to her a sort of public character,
almost like Robinson Crusoe or Captain Cook; and Penny had always wished
her husband to be a remarkable personage, likely to be put in Mangnall&rsquo;s
Questions, with which register of the immortals she had become acquainted
during her one year at a boarding-school.&nbsp; Only it seemed strange
that a remarkable man should be a confectioner and pastry-cook, and
this anomaly quite disturbed Penny&rsquo;s dreams.&nbsp; Her brothers,
she knew, laughed at men who couldn&rsquo;t sit on horseback well, and
called them tailors; but her brothers were very rough, and were quite
without that power of anecdote which made Mr. Freely such a delightful
companion.&nbsp; He was a very good man, she thought, for she had heard
him say at Mr. Luff&rsquo;s, one day, that he always wished to do his
duty in whatever state of life he might be placed; and he knew a great
deal of poetry, for one day he had repeated a verse of a song.&nbsp;
She wondered if he had made the words of the valentine!&mdash;it ended
in this way:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Without thee, it is pain to live,<br />
But with thee, it were sweet to die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor Mr. Freely! her father would very likely object&mdash;she felt
sure he would, for he always called Mr. Freely &ldquo;that sugar-plum
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, it was very cruel, when true love was crossed
in that way, and all because Mr. Freely was a confectioner: well, Penny
would be true to him, for all that, and since his being a confectioner
gave her an opportunity of showing her faithfulness, she was glad of
it.&nbsp; Edward Freely was a pretty name, much better than John Towers.&nbsp;
Young Towers had offered her a rose out of his button-hole the other
day, blushing very much; but she refused it, and thought with delight
how much Mr. Freely would be comforted if he knew her firmness of mind.</p>
<p>Poor little Penny! the days were so very long among the daisies on
a grazing farm, and thought is so active&mdash;how was it possible that
the inward drama should not get the start of the outward?&nbsp; I have
known young ladies, much better educated, and with an outward world
diversified by instructive lectures, to say nothing of literature and
highly-developed fancy-work, who have spun a cocoon of visionary joys
and sorrows for themselves, just as Penny did.&nbsp; Her elder sister
Letitia, who had a prouder style of beauty, and a more worldly ambition,
was engaged to a wool-factor, who came all the way from Cattelton to
see her; and everybody knows that a wool-factor takes a very high rank,
sometimes driving a double-bodied gig.&nbsp; Letty&rsquo;s notions got
higher every day, and Penny never dared to speak of her cherished griefs
to her lofty sister&mdash;never dared to propose that they should call
at Mr. Freely&rsquo;s to buy liquorice, though she had prepared for
such an incident by mentioning a slight sore throat.&nbsp; So she had
to pass the shop on the other side of the market-place, and reflect,
with a suppressed sigh, that behind those pink and white jars somebody
was thinking of her tenderly, unconscious of the small space that divided
her from him.</p>
<p>And it was quite true that, when business permitted, Mr. Freely thought
a great deal of Penny.&nbsp; He thought her prettiness comparable to
the loveliest things in confectionery; he judged her to be of submissive
temper&mdash;likely to wait upon him as well as if she had been a negress,
and to be silently terrified when his liver made him irritable; and
he considered the Palfrey family quite the best in the parish, possessing
marriageable daughters.&nbsp; On the whole, he thought her worthy to
become Mrs. Edward Freely, and all the more so, because it would probably
require some ingenuity to win her.&nbsp; Mr. Palfrey was capable of
horse-whipping a too rash pretender to his daughter&rsquo;s hand; and,
moreover, he had three tall sons: it was clear that a suitor would be
at a disadvantage with such a family, unless travel and natural acumen
had given him a countervailing power of contrivance.&nbsp; And the first
idea that occurred to him in the matter was, that Mr. Palfrey would
object less if he knew that the Freelys were a much higher family than
his own.&nbsp; It had been foolish modesty in him hitherto to conceal
the fact that a branch of the Freelys held a manor in Yorkshire, and
to shut up the portrait of his great uncle the admiral, instead of hanging
it up where a family portrait should be hung&mdash;over the mantelpiece
in the parlour.&nbsp; Admiral Freely, K.C.B., once placed in this conspicuous
position, was seen to have had one arm only, and one eye&mdash;in these
points resembling the heroic Nelson&mdash;while a certain pallid insignificance
of feature confirmed the relationship between himself and his grand-nephew.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Freely was seized with an irrepressible ambition to posses
Mrs. Palfrey&rsquo;s receipt for brawn, hers being pronounced on all
hands to be superior to his own&mdash;as he informed her in a very flattering
letter carried by his errand-boy.&nbsp; Now Mrs. Palfrey, like other
geniuses, wrought by instinct rather than by rule, and possessed no
receipts&mdash;indeed, despised all people who used them, observing
that people who pickled by book, must pickle by weights and measures,
and such nonsense; as for herself, her weights and measures were the
tip of her finger and the tip of her tongue, and if you went nearer,
why, of course, for dry goods like flour and spice, you went by handfuls
and pinches, and for wet, there was a middle-sized jug&mdash;quite the
best thing whether for much or little, because you might know how much
a teacupful was if you&rsquo;d got any use of your senses, and you might
be sure it would take five middle-sized jugs to make a gallon.&nbsp;
Knowledge of this kind is like Titian&rsquo;s colouring, difficult to
communicate; and as Mrs. Palfrey, once remarkably handsome, had now
become rather stout and asthmatical, and scarcely ever left home, her
oral teaching could hardly be given anywhere except at Long Meadows.&nbsp;
Even a matron is not insusceptible to flattery, and the prospect of
a visitor whose great object would be to listen to her conversation,
was not without its charms to Mrs. Palfrey.&nbsp; Since there was no
receipt to be sent in reply to Mr. Freely&rsquo;s humble request, she
called on her more docile daughter, Penny, to write a note, telling
him that her mother would be glad to see him and talk with him on brawn,
any day that he could call at Long Meadows.&nbsp; Penny obeyed with
a trembling hand, thinking how wonderfully things came about in this
world.</p>
<p>In this way, Mr. Freely got himself introduced into the home of the
Palfreys, and notwithstanding a tendency in the male part of the family
to jeer at him a little as &ldquo;peaky&rdquo; and bow-legged, he presently
established his position as an accepted and frequent guest.&nbsp; Young
Towers looked at him with increasing disgust when they met at the house
on a Sunday, and secretly longed to try his ferret upon him, as a piece
of vermin which that valuable animal would be likely to tackle with
unhesitating vigour.&nbsp; But&mdash;so blind sometimes are parents&mdash;neither
Mr. nor Mrs. Palfrey suspected that Penny would have anything to say
to a tradesman of questionable rank whose youthful bloom was much withered.&nbsp;
Young Towers, they thought, had an eye to her, and <i>that</i> was likely
enough to be a match some day; but Penny was a child at present.&nbsp;
And all the while Penny was imagining the circumstances under which
Mr. Freely would make her an offer: perhaps down by the row of damson-trees,
when they were in the garden before tea; perhaps by letter&mdash;in
which case, how would the letter begin?&nbsp; &ldquo;Dearest Penelope?&rdquo;
or &ldquo;My dear Miss Penelope?&rdquo; or straight off, without dear
anything, as seemed the most natural when people were embarrassed?&nbsp;
But, however he might make the offer, she would not accept it without
her father&rsquo;s consent: she would always be true to Mr. Freely,
but she would not disobey her father.&nbsp; For Penny was a good girl,
though some of her female friends were afterwards of opinion that it
spoke ill for her not to have felt an instinctive repugnance to Mr.
Freely.</p>
<p>But he was cautious, and wished to be quite sure of the ground he
trod on.&nbsp; His views on marriage were not entirely sentimental,
but were as duly mingled with considerations of what would be advantageous
to a man in his position, as if he had had a very large amount of money
spent on his education.&nbsp; He was not a man to fall in love in the
wrong place; and so, he applied himself quite as much to conciliate
the favour of the parents, as to secure the attachment of Penny.&nbsp;
Mrs. Palfrey had not been inaccessible to flattery, and her husband,
being also of mortal mould, would not, it might be hoped, be proof against
rum&mdash;that very fine Jamaica rum&mdash;of which Mr. Freely expected
always to have a supply sent him from Jamaica.&nbsp; It was not easy
to get Mr. Palfrey into the parlour behind the shop, where a mild back-street
light fell on the features of the heroic admiral; but by getting hold
of him rather late one evening as he was about to return home from Grimworth,
the aspiring lover succeeded in persuading him to sup on some collared
beef which, after Mrs. Palfrey&rsquo;s brawn, he would find the very
best of cold eating.</p>
<p>From that hour Mr. Freely felt sure of success: being in privacy
with an estimable man old enough to be his father, and being rather
lonely in the world, it was natural he should unbosom himself a little
on subjects which he could not speak of in a mixed circle&mdash;especially
concerning his expectations from his uncle in Jamaica, who had no children,
and loved his nephew Edward better than any one else in the world, though
he had been so hurt at his leaving Jamaica, that he had threatened to
cut him off with a shilling.&nbsp; However, he had since written to
state his full forgiveness, and though he was an eccentric old gentleman
and could not bear to give away money during his life, Mr. Edward Freely
could show Mr. Palfrey the letter which declared, plainly enough, who
would be the affectionate uncle&rsquo;s heir.&nbsp; Mr. Palfrey actually
saw the letter, and could not help admiring the spirit of the nephew
who declared that such brilliant hopes as these made no difference to
his conduct; he should work at his humble business and make his modest
fortune at it all the same.&nbsp; If the Jamaica estate was to come
to him&mdash;well and good.&nbsp; It was nothing very surprising for
one of the Freely family to have an estate left him, considering the
lands that family had possessed in time gone by&mdash;nay, still possessed
in the Northumberland branch.&nbsp; Would not Mr. Palfrey take another
glass of rum? and also look at the last year&rsquo;s balance of the
accounts?&nbsp; Mr. Freely was a man who cared to possess personal virtues,
and did not pique himself on his family, though some men would.</p>
<p>We know how easily the great Leviathan may be led, when once there
is a hook in his nose or a bridle in his jaws.&nbsp; Mr. Palfrey was
a large man, but, like Leviathan&rsquo;s, his bulk went against him
when once he had taken a turning.&nbsp; He was not a mercurial man,
who easily changed his point of view.&nbsp; Enough.&nbsp; Before two
months were over, he had given his consent to Mr. Freely&rsquo;s marriage
with his daughter Penny, and having hit on a formula by which he could
justify it, fenced off all doubts and objections, his own included.&nbsp;
The formula was this: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a man to put my head up an
entry before I know where it leads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Penny was very proud and fluttering, but hardly so happy as
she expected to be in an engagement.&nbsp; She wondered if young Towers
cared much about it, for he had not been to the house lately, and her
sister and brothers were rather inclined to sneer than to sympathize.&nbsp;
Grimworth rang with the news.&nbsp; All men extolled Mr. Freely&rsquo;s
good fortune; while the women, with the tender solicitude characteristic
of the sex, wished the marriage might turn out well.</p>
<p>While affairs were at this triumphant juncture, Mr. Freely one morning
observed that a stone-carver who had been breakfasting in the eating-room
had left a newspaper behind.&nbsp; It was the <i>X-shire Gazette</i>,
and X-shire being a county not unknown to Mr. Freely, he felt some curiosity
to glance over it, and especially over the advertisements.&nbsp; A slight
flush came over his face as he read.&nbsp; It was produced by the following
announcement:&mdash;&ldquo;If David Faux, son of Jonathan Faux, late
of Gilsbrook, will apply at the office of Mr. Strutt, attorney, of Rodham,
he will hear of something to his advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Freely, involuntarily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can he have left me a legacy?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Perhaps it was a result quite different from your expectations, that
Mr. David Faux should have returned from the West Indies only a few
years after his arrival there, and have set up in his old business,
like any plain man who has never travelled.&nbsp; But these cases do
occur in life.&nbsp; Since, as we know, men change their skies and see
new constellations without changing their souls, it will follow sometimes
that they don&rsquo;t change their business under those novel circumstances.</p>
<p>Certainly, this result was contrary to David&rsquo;s own expectations.&nbsp;
He had looked forward, you are aware, to a brilliant career among &ldquo;the
blacks&rdquo;; but, either because they had already seen too many white
men, or for some other reason, they did not at once recognize him as
a superior order of human being; besides, there were no princesses among
them.&nbsp; Nobody in Jamaica was anxious to maintain David for the
mere pleasure of his society; and those hidden merits of a man which
are so well known to himself were as little recognized there as they
notoriously are in the effete society of the Old World.&nbsp; So that
in the dark hints that David threw out at the Oyster Club about that
life of Sultanic self-indulgence spent by him in the luxurious Indies,
I really think he was doing himself a wrong; I believe he worked for
his bread, and, in fact, took to cooking as, after all, the only department
in which he could offer skilled labour.&nbsp; He had formed several
ingenious plans by which he meant to circumvent people of large fortune
and small faculty; but then he never met with exactly the right circumstances.&nbsp;
David&rsquo;s devices for getting rich without work had apparently no
direct relation with the world outside him, as his confectionery receipts
had.&nbsp; It is possible to pass a great many bad half pennies and
bad half-crowns, but I believe there has no instance been known of passing
a halfpenny or a half-crown as a sovereign.&nbsp; A sharper can drive
a brisk trade in this world: it is undeniable that there may be a fine
career for him, if he will dare consequences; but David was too timid
to be a sharper, or venture in any way among the mantraps of the law.&nbsp;
He dared rob nobody but his mother.&nbsp; And so he had to fall back
on the genuine value there was in him&mdash;to be content to pass as
a good halfpenny, or, to speak more accurately, as a good confectioner.&nbsp;
For in spite of some additional reading and observation, there was nothing
else he could make so much money by; nay, he found in himself even a
capability of extending his skill in this direction, and embracing all
forms of cookery; while, in other branches of human labour, he began
to see that it was not possible for him to shine.&nbsp; Fate was too
strong for him; he had thought to master her inclination and had fled
over the seas to that end; but she caught him, tied an apron round him,
and snatching him from all other devices, made him devise cakes and
patties in a kitchen at Kingstown.&nbsp; He was getting submissive to
her, since she paid him with tolerable gains; but fevers and prickly
heat, and other evils incidental to cooks in ardent climates, made him
long for his native land; so he took ship once more, carrying his six
years&rsquo; savings, and seeing distinctly, this time, what were Fate&rsquo;s
intentions as to his career.&nbsp; If you question me closely as to
whether all the money with which he set up at Grimworth consisted of
pure and simple earnings, I am obliged to confess that he got a sum
or two for charitably abstaining from mentioning some other people&rsquo;s
misdemeanours.&nbsp; Altogether, since no prospects were attached to
his family name, and since a new christening seemed a suitable commencement
of a new life, Mr. David Faux thought it as well to call himself Mr.
Edward Freely.</p>
<p>But lo! now, in opposition to all calculable probability, some benefit
appeared to be attached to the name of David Faux.&nbsp; Should he neglect
it, as beneath the attention of a prosperous tradesman?&nbsp; It might
bring him into contact with his family again, and he felt no yearnings
in that direction: moreover, he had small belief that the &ldquo;something
to his advantage&rdquo; could be anything considerable.&nbsp; On the
other hand, even a small gain is pleasant, and the promise of it in
this instance was so surprising, that David felt his curiosity awakened.&nbsp;
The scale dipped at last on the side of writing to the lawyer, and,
to be brief, the correspondence ended in an appointment for a meeting
between David and his eldest brother at Mr. Strutt&rsquo;s, the vague
&ldquo;something&rdquo; having been defined as a legacy from his father
of eighty-two pounds, three shillings.</p>
<p>David, you know, had expected to be disinherited; and so he would
have been, if he had not, like some other indifferent sons, come of
excellent parents, whose conscience made them scrupulous where much
more highly-instructed people often feel themselves warranted in following
the bent of their indignation.&nbsp; Good Mrs. Faux could never forget
that she had brought this ill-conditioned son into the world when he
was in that entirely helpless state which excluded the smallest choice
on his part; and, somehow or other, she felt that his going wrong would
be his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s fault, if they failed in one
tittle of their parental duty.&nbsp; Her notion of parental duty was
not of a high and subtle kind, but it included giving him his due share
of the family property; for when a man had got a little honest money
of his own, was he so likely to steal?&nbsp; To cut the delinquent son
off with a shilling, was like delivering him over to his evil propensities.&nbsp;
No; let the sum of twenty guineas which he had stolen be deducted from
his share, and then let the sum of three guineas be put back from it,
seeing that his mother had always considered three of the twenty guineas
as his; and, though he had run away, and was, perhaps, gone across the
sea, let the money be left to him all the same, and be kept in reserve
for his possible return.&nbsp; Mr. Faux agreed to his wife&rsquo;s views,
and made a codicil to his will accordingly, in time to die with a clear
conscience.&nbsp; But for some time his family thought it likely that
David would never reappear; and the eldest son, who had the charge of
Jacob on his hands, often thought it a little hard that David might
perhaps be dead, and yet, for want of certitude on that point, his legacy
could not fall to his legal heir.&nbsp; But in this state of things
the opposite certitude&mdash;namely, that David was still alive and
in England&mdash;seemed to be brought by the testimony of a neighbour,
who, having been on a journey to Cattelton, was pretty sure he had seen
David in a gig, with a stout man driving by his side.&nbsp; He could
&ldquo;swear it was David,&rdquo; though he could &ldquo;give no account
why, for he had no marks on him; but no more had a white dog, and that
didn&rsquo;t hinder folks from knowing a white dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was this incident which had led to the advertisement.</p>
<p>The legacy was paid, of course, after a few preliminary disclosures
as to Mr. David&rsquo;s actual position.&nbsp; He begged to send his
love to his mother, and to say that he hoped to pay her a dutiful visit
by and by; but, at present, his business and near prospect of marriage
made it difficult for him to leave home.&nbsp; His brother replied with
much frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother may do as she likes about having you to see her,
but, for my part, I don&rsquo;t want to catch sight of you on the premises
again.&nbsp; When folks have taken a new name, they&rsquo;d better keep
to their new &rsquo;quinetance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David pocketed the insult along with the eighty-two pounds three,
and travelled home again in some triumph at the ease of a transaction
which had enriched him to this extent.&nbsp; He had no intention of
offending his brother by further claims on his fraternal recognition,
and relapsed with full contentment into the character of Mr. Edward
Freely, the orphan, scion of a great but reduced family, with an eccentric
uncle in the West Indies.&nbsp; (I have already hinted that he had some
acquaintance with imaginative literature; and being of a practical turn,
he had, you perceive, applied even this form of knowledge to practical
purposes.)</p>
<p>It was little more than a week after the return from his fruitful
journey, that the day of his marriage with Penny having been fixed,
it was agreed that Mrs. Palfrey should overcome her reluctance to move
from home, and that she and her husband should bring their two daughters
to inspect little Penny&rsquo;s future abode and decide on the new arrangements
to be made for the reception of the bride.&nbsp; Mr. Freely meant her
to have a house so pretty and comfortable that she need not envy even
a wool-factor&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Of course, the upper room over the
shop was to be the best sitting-room; but also the parlour behind the
shop was to be made a suitable bower for the lovely Penny, who would
naturally wish to be near her husband, though Mr. Freely declared his
resolution never to allow <i>his</i> wife to wait in the shop.&nbsp;
The decisions about the parlour furniture were left till last, because
the party was to take tea there; and, about five o&rsquo;clock, they
were all seated there with the best muffins and buttered buns before
them, little Penny blushing and smiling, with her &ldquo;crop&rdquo;
in the best order, and a blue frock showing her little white shoulders,
while her opinion was being always asked and never given.&nbsp; She
secretly wished to have a particular sort of chimney ornaments, but
she could not have brought herself to mention it.&nbsp; Seated by the
side of her yellow and rather withered lover, who, though he had not
reached his thirtieth year, had already crow&rsquo;s-feet about his
eyes, she was quite tremulous at the greatness of her lot in being married
to a man who had travelled so much&mdash;and before her sister Letty!&nbsp;
The handsome Letitia looked rather proud and contemptuous, thought her
nature brother-in-law an odious person, and was vexed with her father
and mother for letting Penny marry him.&nbsp; Dear little Penny!&nbsp;
She certainly did look like a fresh white-heart cherry going to be bitten
off the stem by that lipless mouth.&nbsp; Would no deliverer come to
make a slip between that cherry and that mouth without a lip?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a family likeness between the admiral and you, Mr. Freely,&rdquo;
observed Mrs. Palfrey, who was looking at the family portrait for the
first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful! and only a grand-uncle.&nbsp;
Do you feature the rest of your family, as you know of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said Mr. Freely, with a sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My family have mostly thought themselves too high to take any
notice of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment an extraordinary disturbance was heard in the shop,
as of a heavy animal stamping about and making angry noises, and then
of a glass vessel falling in shivers, while the voice of the apprentice
was heard calling &ldquo;Master&rdquo; in great alarm.</p>
<p>Mr. Freely rose in anxious astonishment, and hastened into the shop,
followed by the four Palfreys, who made a group at the parlour-door,
transfixed with wonder at seeing a large man in a smock-frock, with
a pitchfork in his hand, rush up to Mr. Freely and hug him, crying out,&mdash;&ldquo;Zavy,
Zavy, b&rsquo;other Zavy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Jacob, and for some moments David lost all presence of mind.&nbsp;
He felt arrested for having stolen his mother&rsquo;s guineas.&nbsp;
He turned cold, and trembled in his brother&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said Mr. Palfrey, advancing
from the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob supplied the answer by saying over and over again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se Zacob, b&rsquo;other Zacob.&nbsp; Come &rsquo;o
zee Zavy&rdquo;&mdash;till hunger prompted him to relax his grasp, and
to seize a large raised pie, which he lifted to his mouth.</p>
<p>By this time David&rsquo;s power of device had begun to return, but
it was a very hard task for his prudence to master his rage and hatred
towards poor Jacob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who he is; he must be drunk,&rdquo; he
said, in a low tone to Mr. Palfrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s dangerous
with that pitchfork.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll never let it go.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then checking himself on the point of betraying too great an intimacy
with Jacob&rsquo;s habits, he added &ldquo;You watch him, while I run
for the constable.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he hurried out of the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where do you come from, my man?&rdquo; said Mr. Palfrey,
speaking to Jacob in a conciliatory tone.&nbsp; Jacob was eating his
pie by large mouthfuls, and looking round at the other good things in
the shop, while he embraced his pitchfork with his left arm, and laid
his left hand on some Bath buns.&nbsp; He was in the rare position of
a person who recovers a long absent friend and finds him richer than
ever in the characteristics that won his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s Zacob&mdash;b&rsquo;other Zacob&mdash;&rsquo;t home.&nbsp;
I love Zavy&mdash;b&rsquo;other Zavy,&rdquo; he said, as soon as Mr.
Palfrey had drawn his attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zavy come back from z&rsquo;
Indies&mdash;got mother&rsquo;s zinnies.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Zavy?&rdquo;
he added, looking round and then turning to the others with a questioning
air, puzzled by David&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; observed Mr. Palfrey to his wife
and daughters.&nbsp; &ldquo;He seems to say Freely&rsquo;s his brother
come back from th&rsquo; Indies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant relation for us!&rdquo; said Letitia, sarcastically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a good deal like Mr. Freely.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
got just the same sort of nose, and his eyes are the same colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Penny was ready to cry.</p>
<p>But now Mr. Freely re-entered the shop without the constable.&nbsp;
During his walk of a few yards he had had time and calmness enough to
widen his view of consequences, and he saw that to get Jacob taken to
the workhouse or to the lock-up house as an offensive stranger might
have awkward effects if his family took the trouble of inquiring after
him.&nbsp; He must resign himself to more patient measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On second thoughts,&rdquo; he said, beckoning to Mr. Palfrey
and whispering to him while Jacob&rsquo;s back was turned, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
a poor half-witted fellow.&nbsp; Perhaps his friends will come after
him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind giving him something to eat, and letting
him lie down for the night.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got it into his head that
he knows me&mdash;they do get these fancies, idiots do.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
perhaps go away again in an hour or two, and make no more ado.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a kind-hearted man <i>myself</i>&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t like
to have the poor fellow ill-used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;ll eat a sovereign&rsquo;s worth in no time,&rdquo;
said Mr. Palfrey, thinking Mr. Freely a little too magnificent in his
generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, Zavy, come back?&rdquo; exclaimed Jacob, giving his dear
brother another hug, which crushed Mr. Freely&rsquo;s features inconveniently
against the stale of the pitchfork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said Mr. Freely, smiling, with every capability
of murder in his mind, except the courage to commit it.&nbsp; He wished
the Bath buns might by chance have arsenic in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s zinnies?&rdquo; said Jacob, pointing to a glass
jar of yellow lozenges that stood in the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zive &rsquo;em
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David dared not do otherwise than reach down the glass jar and give
Jacob a handful.&nbsp; He received them in his smock-frock, which he
held out for more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll keep him quiet a bit, at any rate,&rdquo; thought
David, and emptied the jar.&nbsp; Jacob grinned and mowed with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good to this stranger, Mr. Freely,&rdquo;
said Letitia; and then spitefully, as David joined the party at the
parlour-door, &ldquo;I think you could hardly treat him better, if he
was really your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought it a duty to be good to idiots,&rdquo;
said Mr. Freely, striving after the most moral view of the subject.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We might have been idiots ourselves&mdash;everybody might have
been born idiots, instead of having their right senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where there&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been victual
for us all then,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Palfrey, regarding the matter
in a housewifely light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us sit down again and finish our tea,&rdquo; said
Mr. Freely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us leave the poor creature to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked into the parlour again; but Jacob, not apparently appreciating
the kindness of leaving him to himself, immediately followed his brother,
and seated himself, pitchfork grounded, at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Letitia, rising, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether <i>you</i> mean to stay, mother; but I shall go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, me too,&rdquo; said Penny, frightened to death at Jacob,
who had begun to nod and grin at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we <i>had</i> better be going, Mr. Palfrey,&rdquo;
said the mother, rising more slowly.</p>
<p>Mr. Freely, whose complexion had become decidedly yellower during
the last half-hour, did not resist this proposition.&nbsp; He hoped
they should meet again &ldquo;under happier circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief the man is his brother,&rdquo; said Letitia,
when they were all on their way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Palfrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Freely&rsquo;s
got no brother&mdash;he&rsquo;s said so many and many a time; he&rsquo;s
an orphan; he&rsquo;s got nothing but uncles&mdash;leastwise, one.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s it matter what an idiot says?&nbsp; What call had Freely
to tell lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letitia tossed her head and was silent.</p>
<p>Mr. Freely, left alone with his affectionate brother Jacob, brooded
over the possibility of luring him out of the town early the next morning,
and getting him conveyed to Gilsbrook without further betrayals.&nbsp;
But the thing was difficult.&nbsp; He saw clearly that if he took Jacob
himself, his absence, conjoined with the disappearance of the stranger,
would either cause the conviction that he was really a relative, or
would oblige him to the dangerous course of inventing a story to account
for his disappearance, and his own absence at the same time.&nbsp; David
groaned.&nbsp; There come occasions when falsehood is felt to be inconvenient.&nbsp;
It would, perhaps, have been a longer-headed device, if he had never
told any of those clever fibs about his uncles, grand and otherwise;
for the Palfreys were simple people, and shared the popular prejudice
against lying.&nbsp; Even if he could get Jacob away this time, what
security was there that he would not come again, having once found the
way?&nbsp; O guineas!&nbsp; O lozenges! what enviable people those were
who had never robbed their mothers, and had never told fibs!&nbsp; David
spent a sleepless night, while Jacob was snoring close by.&nbsp; Was
this the upshot of travelling to the Indies, and acquiring experience
combined with anecdote?</p>
<p>He rose at break of day, as he had once before done when he was in
fear of Jacob, and took all gentle means to rouse this fatal brother
from his deep sleep; he dared not be loud, because his apprentice was
in the house, and would report everything.&nbsp; But Jacob was not to
be roused.&nbsp; He fought out with his fist at the unknown cause of
disturbance, turned over, and snored again.&nbsp; He must be left to
wake as he would.&nbsp; David, with a cold perspiration on his brow,
confessed to himself that Jacob could not be got away that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Palfrey came over to Grimworth before noon, with a natural curiosity
to see how his future son-in-law got on with the stranger to whom he
was so benevolently inclined.&nbsp; He found a crowd round the shop.&nbsp;
All Grimworth by this time had heard how Freely had been fastened on
by an idiot, who called him &ldquo;Brother Zavy&rdquo;; and the younger
population seemed to find the singular stranger an unwearying source
of fascination, while the householders dropped in one by one to inquire
into the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send him to the workhouse?&rdquo; said
Mr. Prettyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a row with him and the
children presently, and he&rsquo;ll eat you up.&nbsp; The workhouse
is the proper place for him; let his kin claim him, if he&rsquo;s got
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those may be <i>your</i> feelings, Mr. Prettyman,&rdquo; said
David, his mind quite enfeebled by the torture of his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! <i>is</i> he your brother, then?&rdquo; said Mr. Prettyman,
looking at his neighbour Freely rather sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All men are our brothers, and idiots particular so,&rdquo;
said Mr. Freely, who, like many other travelled men, was not master
of the English language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, if he&rsquo;s your brother, tell the truth, man,&rdquo;
said Mr. Prettyman, with growing suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be ashamed of your own flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Palfrey was present, and also had his eye on Freely.&nbsp; It
is difficult for a man to believe in the advantage of a truth which
will disclose him to have been a liar.&nbsp; In this critical moment,
David shrank from this immediate disgrace in the eyes of his future
father-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Prettyman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I take your observations
as an insult.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no reason to be otherwise than proud
of my own flesh and blood.&nbsp; If this poor man was my brother more
than all men are, I should say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall figure darkened the door, and David, lifting his eyes in that
direction, saw his eldest brother, Jonathan, on the door-sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay wi&rsquo; Zavy,&rdquo; shouted Jacob, as he,
too, caught sight of his eldest brother; and, running behind the counter,
he clutched David hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, he <i>is</i> here?&rdquo; said Jonathan Faux, coming
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother would have no nay, as he&rsquo;d been
away so long, but I must see after him.&nbsp; And it struck me he was
very like come after you, because we&rsquo;d been talking of you o&rsquo;
late, and where you lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David saw there was no escape; he smiled a ghastly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! is this a relation of yours, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Palfrey
to Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, it&rsquo;s my innicent of a brother, sure enough,&rdquo;
said honest Jonathan.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine trouble and cost he is to
us, in th&rsquo; eating and other things, but we must bear what&rsquo;s
laid on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your name&rsquo;s Freely, is it?&rdquo; said Mr. Prettyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, my name&rsquo;s Faux, I know nothing o&rsquo; Freelys,&rdquo;
said Jonathan, curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he added, turning to
David, &ldquo;I must take some news to mother about Jacob.&nbsp; Shall
I take him with me, or will you undertake to send him back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him, if you can make him loose his hold of me,&rdquo;
said David, feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this gentleman here in the confectionery line your brother,
then, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Prettyman, feeling that it was an occasion
on which format language must be used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to own him,&rdquo; said Jonathan,
unable to resist a movement of indignation that had never been allowed
to satisfy itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ran away from home with good reasons
in his pocket years ago: he didn&rsquo;t want to be owned again, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Palfrey left the shop; he felt his own pride too severely wounded
by the sense that he had let himself be fooled, to feel curiosity for
further details.&nbsp; The most pressing business was to go home and
tell his daughter that Freely was a poor sneak, probably a rascal, and
that her engagement was broken off.</p>
<p>Mr. Prettyman stayed, with some internal self-gratulation that <i>he</i>
had never given in to Freely, and that Mr. Chaloner would see now what
sort of fellow it was that he had put over the heads of older parishioners.&nbsp;
He considered it due from him (Mr. Prettyman) that, for the interests
of the parish, he should know all that was to be known about this &ldquo;interloper.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Grimworth would have people coming from Botany Bay to settle in it,
if things went on in this way.</p>
<p>It soon appeared that Jacob could not be made to quit his dear brother
David except by force.&nbsp; He understood, with a clearness equal to
that of the most intelligent mind, that Jonathan would take him back
to skimmed milk, apple-dumpling, broad beans, and pork.&nbsp; And he
had found a paradise in his brother&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; It was a difficult
matter to use force with Jacob, for he wore heavy nailed boots; and
if his pitchfork had been mastered, he would have resorted without hesitation
to kicks.&nbsp; Nothing short of using guile to bind him hand and foot
would have made all parties safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him stay,&rdquo; said David, with desperate resignation,
frightened above all things at the idea of further disturbances in his
shop, which would make his exposure all the more conspicuous.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>You</i> go away again, and to-morrow I can, perhaps, get him
to go to Gilsbrook with me.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll follow me fast enough,
I daresay,&rdquo; he added, with a half-groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Jonathan, gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see why <i>you</i> shouldn&rsquo;t have some trouble and expense with
him as well as the rest of us.&nbsp; But mind you bring him back safe
and soon, else mother&rsquo;ll never rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this arrangement being concluded, Mr. Prettyman begged Mr. Jonathan
Faux to go and take a snack with him, an invitation which was quite
acceptable; and as honest Jonathan had nothing to be ashamed of, it
is probable that he was very frank in his communications to the civil
draper, who, pursuing the benefit of the parish, hastened to make all
the information he could gather about Freely common parochial property.&nbsp;
You may imagine that the meeting of the Club at the Woolpack that evening
was unusually lively.&nbsp; Every member was anxious to prove that he
had never liked Freely, as he called himself.&nbsp; Faux was his name,
was it?&nbsp; Fox would have been more suitable.&nbsp; The majority
expressed a desire to see him hooted out of the town.</p>
<p>Mr. Freely did not venture over his door-sill that day, for he knew
Jacob would keep at his side, and there was every probability that they
would have a train of juvenile followers.&nbsp; He sent to engage the
Woolpack gig for an early hour the next morning; but this order was
not kept religiously a secret by the landlord.&nbsp; Mr. Freely was
informed that he could not have the gig till seven; and the Grimworth
people were early risers.&nbsp; Perhaps they were more alert than usual
on this particular morning; for when Jacob, with a bag of sweets in
his hand, was induced to mount the gig with his brother David, the inhabitants
of the market-place were looking out of their doors and windows, and
at the turning of the street there was even a muster of apprentices
and schoolboys, who shouted as they passed in what Jacob took to be
a very merry and friendly way, nodding and grinning in return.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Huzzay, David Faux! how&rsquo;s your uncle?&rdquo; was their
morning&rsquo;s greeting.&nbsp; Like other pointed things, it was not
altogether impromptu.</p>
<p>Even this public derision was not so crushing to David as the horrible
thought that though he might succeed now in getting Jacob home again
there would never be any security against his coming back, like a wasp
to the honey-pot.&nbsp; As long as David lived at Grimworth, Jacob&rsquo;s
return would be hanging over him.&nbsp; But could he go on living at
Grimworth&mdash;an object of ridicule, discarded by the Palfreys, after
having revelled in the consciousness that he was an envied and prosperous
confectioner?&nbsp; David liked to be envied; he minded less about being
loved.</p>
<p>His doubts on this point were soon settled.&nbsp; The mind of Grimworth
became obstinately set against him and his viands, and the new school
being finished, the eating-room was closed.&nbsp; If there had been
no other reason, sympathy with the Palfreys, that respectable family
who had lived in the parish time out of mind, would have determined
all well-to-do people to decline Freely&rsquo;s goods.&nbsp; Besides,
he had absconded with his mother&rsquo;s guineas: who knew what else
he had done, in Jamaica or elsewhere, before he came to Grimworth, worming
himself into families under false pretences?&nbsp; Females shuddered.&nbsp;
Dreadful suspicions gathered round him: his green eyes, his bow-legs
had a criminal aspect.&nbsp; The rector disliked the sight of a man
who had imposed upon him; and all boys who could not afford to purchase,
hooted &ldquo;David Faux&rdquo; as they passed his shop.&nbsp; Certainly
no man now would pay anything for the &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; of Mr.
Freely&rsquo;s business, and he would be obliged to quit it without
a peculium so desirable towards defraying the expense of moving.</p>
<p>In a few months the shop in the market-place was again to let, and
Mr. David Faux, alias Mr. Edward Freely, had gone&mdash;nobody at Grimworth
knew whither.&nbsp; In this way the demoralization of Grimworth women
was checked.&nbsp; Young Mrs. Steene renewed her efforts to make light
mince-pies, and having at last made a batch so excellent that Mr. Steene
looked at her with complacency as he ate them, and said they were the
best he had ever eaten in his life, she thought less of bulbuls and
renegades ever after.&nbsp; The secrets of the finer cookery were revived
in the breasts of matronly house-wives, and daughters were again anxious
to be initiated in them.</p>
<p>You will further, I hope, be glad to bear, that some purchases of
drapery made by pretty Penny, in preparation for her marriage with Mr.
Freely, came in quite as well for her wedding with young Towers as if
they had been made expressly for the latter occasion.&nbsp; For Penny&rsquo;s
complexion had not altered, and blue always became it best.</p>
<p>Here ends the story of Mr. David Faux, confectioner, and his brother
Jacob.&nbsp; And we see in it, I think, an admirable instance of the
unexpected forms in which the great Nemesis hides herself.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
