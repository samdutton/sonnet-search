<STAGEDIR>Enter Gower.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To sing a song that old was sung,</LINE>
<LINE>From ashes ancient Gower is come,</LINE>
<LINE>Assuming man&#8217;s infirmities,</LINE>
<LINE>To glad your ear and please your eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>It hath been sung at festivals,</LINE>
<LINE>On ember-eves and holy-ales;</LINE>
<LINE>And lords and ladies in their lives</LINE>
<LINE>Have read it for restoratives.</LINE>
<LINE>The purchase is to make men glorious,</LINE>
<LINE>Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.</LINE>
<LINE>If you, born in those latter times,</LINE>
<LINE>When wit&#8217;s more ripe, accept my rhymes,</LINE>
<LINE>And that to hear an old man sing</LINE>
<LINE>May to your wishes pleasure bring,</LINE>
<LINE>I life would wish, and that I might</LINE>
<LINE>Waste it for you like taper-light.</LINE>
<LINE>This&#8217; Antioch, then; Antiochus the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Built up this city for his chiefest seat,</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest in all Syria&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you what mine authors say.</LINE>
<LINE>This king unto him took a peer,</LINE>
<LINE>Who died and left a female heir,</LINE>
<LINE>So buxom, blithe, and full of face</LINE>
<LINE>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</LINE>
<LINE>With whom the father liking took,</LINE>
<LINE>And her to incest did provoke&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Bad child, worse father, to entice his own</LINE>
<LINE>To evil should be done by none.</LINE>
<LINE>But custom what they did begin</LINE>
<LINE>Was with long use account&#8217;d no sin.</LINE>
<LINE>The beauty of this sinful dame</LINE>
<LINE>Made many princes thither frame</LINE>
<LINE>To seek her as a bedfellow,</LINE>
<LINE>In marriage pleasures playfellow;</LINE>
<LINE>Which to prevent he made a law,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep her still and men in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>That whoso ask&#8217;d her for his wife,</LINE>
<LINE>His riddle told not, lost his life.</LINE>
<LINE>So for her many a wight did die,</LINE>
<LINE>As yon grim looks do testify.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Points to the heads of the unsuccessful suitors, displayed above.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</LINE>
<LINE>I give my cause, who best can justify.</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>Antioch. A room in the palace.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Antiochus, Prince Pericles, Followers, Perdita, Daughter of Antiochus, Thaliard, Messenger)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Antiochus, Prince Pericles, and Followers.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large received</LINE>
<LINE>The danger of the task you undertake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, Antiochus, and with a soul</LINE>
<LINE>Embold&#8217;ned with the glory of her praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Music.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride</LINE>
<LINE>For embracements even of Jove himself;</LINE>
<LINE>At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,</LINE>
<LINE>Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence,</LINE>
<LINE>The senate-house of planets all did sit,</LINE>
<LINE>To knit in her their best perfections.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Antiochus&#8217; Daughter.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where she comes, apparelled like the spring,</LINE>
<LINE>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</LINE>
<LINE>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</LINE>
<LINE>Her face the book of praises, where is read</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow were ever ras&#8217;d, and testy wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Could never be her mild companion.</LINE>
<LINE>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</LINE>
<LINE>That have inflam&#8217;d desire in my breast</LINE>
<LINE>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree</LINE>
<LINE>(Or die in th&#8217; adventure), be my helps,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am son and servant to your will,</LINE>
<LINE>To compass such a boundless happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prince Pericles&#8212;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That would be son to great Antiochus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</LINE>
<LINE>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard.</LINE>
<LINE>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</LINE>
<LINE>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</LINE>
<LINE>And which without desert because thine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.</LINE>
<LINE>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn by report, advent&#8217;rous by desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</LINE>
<LINE>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</LINE>
<LINE>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid&#8217;s wars;</LINE>
<LINE>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</LINE>
<LINE>For going on death&#8217;s net, whom none resist.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</LINE>
<LINE>My frail mortality to know itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And by those fearful objects to prepare</LINE>
<LINE>This body, like to them, to what I must;</LINE>
<LINE>For death remembered should be like a mirror,</LINE>
<LINE>Who tells us life&#8217;s but breath, to trust it error.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make my will then, and as sick men do,</LINE>
<LINE>Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</LINE>
<LINE>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</LINE>
<LINE>And all good men, as every prince should do;</LINE>
<LINE>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To the Princess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</LINE>
<LINE>I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then;</LINE>
<LINE>Which read and not expounded, &#8217;tis decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>As these before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all &#8217;say&#8217;d yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</LINE>
<LINE>Of all &#8217;say&#8217;d yet, I wish thee happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a bold champion I assume the lists,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ask advice of any other thought</LINE>
<LINE>But faithfulness and courage.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>The Riddle</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="2">I am no viper, yet I feed</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">On mother&#8217;s flesh which did me breed.</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">I sought a husband, in which labor</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">I found that kindness in a father.</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">He&#8217;s father, son, and husband mild;</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">I mother, wife&#8212;and yet his child.</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">How they may be, and yet in two,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">As you will live, resolve it you.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sharp physic is the last. But O you powers!</LINE>
<LINE>That gives heaven countless eyes to view men&#8217;s acts,</LINE>
<LINE>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</LINE>
<LINE>If this be true which makes me pale to read it?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to the Princess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Fair glass of light, I lov&#8217;d you, and could still,</LINE>
<LINE>Were not this glorious casket stor&#8217;d with ill.</LINE>
<LINE>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt,</LINE>
<LINE>For he&#8217;s no man on whom perfections wait</LINE>
<LINE>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</LINE>
<LINE>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, finger&#8217;d to make man his lawful music,</LINE>
<LINE>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken;</LINE>
<LINE>But being play&#8217;d upon before your time,</LINE>
<LINE>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</LINE>
<LINE>Good sooth, I care not for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,</LINE>
<LINE>For that&#8217;s an article within our law,</LINE>
<LINE>As dangerous as the rest. Your time&#8217;s expir&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great King,</LINE>
<LINE>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</LINE>
<LINE>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s more secure to keep it shut than shown;</LINE>
<LINE>For vice repeated is like the wand&#8217;ring wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Blows dust in others&#8217; eyes, to spread itself;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</LINE>
<LINE>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear</LINE>
<LINE>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</LINE>
<LINE>Copp&#8217;d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By man&#8217;s oppression, and the poor worm doth die for&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>Kings are earth&#8217;s gods; in vice their law&#8217;s their will;</LINE>
<LINE>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</LINE>
<LINE>It is enough you know, and it is fit,</LINE>
<LINE>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</LINE>
<LINE>All love the womb that their first being bred,</LINE>
<LINE>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the meaning.</LINE>
<LINE>But I will gloze with him.&#8212;Young Prince of Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</LINE>
<LINE>Your exposition misinterpreting,</LINE>
<LINE>We might proceed to cancel of your days;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</LINE>
<LINE>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise.</LINE>
<LINE>Forty days longer we do respite you;</LINE>
<LINE>If by which time our secret be undone,</LINE>
<LINE>This mercy shows we&#8217;ll joy in such a son;</LINE>
<LINE>And until then your entertain shall be</LINE>
<LINE>As doth befit our honor and your worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manet Pericles solus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,</LINE>
<LINE>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</LINE>
<LINE>The which is good in nothing but in sight!</LINE>
<LINE>If it be true that I interpret false,</LINE>
<LINE>Then were it certain you were not so bad</LINE>
<LINE>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now you&#8217;re both a father and a son</LINE>
<LINE>By your uncomely claspings with your child</LINE>
<LINE>(Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father),</LINE>
<LINE>And she an eater of her mother&#8217;s flesh</LINE>
<LINE>By the defiling of her parent&#8217;s bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</LINE>
<LINE>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</LINE>
<LINE>Antioch, farewell, for wisdom sees those men</LINE>
<LINE>Blush not in actions blacker than the night</LINE>
<LINE>Will &#8217;schew no course to keep them from the light.</LINE>
<LINE>One sin, I know, another doth provoke:</LINE>
<LINE>Murder&#8217;s as near to lust as flame to smoke;</LINE>
<LINE>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and the targets to put off the shame;</LINE>
<LINE>Then lest my life be cropp&#8217;d to keep you clear,</LINE>
<LINE>By flight I&#8217;ll shun the danger which I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Antiochus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath found the meaning,</LINE>
<LINE>For which we mean to have his head.</LINE>
<LINE>He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin</LINE>
<LINE>In such a loathed manner;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore instantly this prince must die,</LINE>
<LINE>For by his fall my honor must keep high.</LINE>
<LINE>Who attends us there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Thaliard.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Doth your Highness call?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thaliard&#8212;you are of our chamber, Thaliard,</LINE>
<LINE>And our mind partakes her private actions</LINE>
<LINE>To your secrecy; and for your faithfulness</LINE>
<LINE>We will advance you, Thaliard. Behold,</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s poison and here&#8217;s gold; we hate the Prince</LINE>
<LINE>Of Tyre, and thou must kill him. It fits thee not</LINE>
<LINE>To ask the reason why, because we bid it.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, is it done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">My lord, &#8217;tis done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Enough.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, Prince Pericles is fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">As thou</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt live, fly after, and like an arrow shot</LINE>
<LINE>From a well-experienc&#8217;d archer hits the mark</LINE>
<LINE>His eye doth level at, so thou never return</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>If I can get him within my pistol&#8217;s length,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make him sure enough; so farewell to your Highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thaliard, adieu!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Thaliard.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Till Pericles be dead,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart can lend no succor to my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SCENETITLE>Scene 2</SCENETITLE>
<SCENELOCATION>Tyre. A room in the palace.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Pericles, Lords, Helicanus)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Pericles with his Lords.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let none disturb us.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lords.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Why should this change of thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>The sad companion, dull-ey&#8217;d melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>Be my so us&#8217;d a guest as not an hour</LINE>
<LINE>In the day&#8217;s glorious walk or peaceful night,</LINE>
<LINE>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</LINE>
<LINE>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</LINE>
<LINE>And danger, which I fear&#8217;d, is at Antioch,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet neither pleasure&#8217;s art can joy my spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor yet the other&#8217;s distance comfort me.</LINE>
<LINE>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</LINE>
<LINE>That have their first conception by misdread,</LINE>
<LINE>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</LINE>
<LINE>And what was first but fear what might be done,</LINE>
<LINE>Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.</LINE>
<LINE>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</LINE>
<LINE>Since he&#8217;s so great can make his will his act,</LINE>
<LINE>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor boots it me to say I honor him,</LINE>
<LINE>If he suspect I may dishonor him;</LINE>
<LINE>And what may make him blush in being known,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll stop the course by which it might be known.</LINE>
<LINE>With hostile forces he&#8217;ll o&#8217;erspread the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And with th&#8217; ostent of war will look so huge,</LINE>
<LINE>Amazement shall drive courage from the state,</LINE>
<LINE>Our men be vanquish&#8217;d ere they do resist,</LINE>
<LINE>And subjects punish&#8217;d that ne&#8217;er thought offense:</LINE>
<LINE>Which care of them, not pity of myself&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</LINE>
<LINE>And punish that before that he would punish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Helicanus and all the Lords to Pericles.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And keep your mind, till you return to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Peaceful and comfortable!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.</LINE>
<LINE>They do abuse the King that flatter him,</LINE>
<LINE>For flattery is the bellows blows up sin,</LINE>
<LINE>The thing the which is flattered, but a spark</LINE>
<LINE>To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,</LINE>
<LINE>Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.</LINE>
<LINE>When Signior Sooth here does proclaim peace,</LINE>
<LINE>He flatters you, makes war upon your life.</LINE>
<LINE>Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot be much lower than my knees.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Kneels.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>

<LINE>All leave us else; but let your cares o&#8217;erlook</LINE>
<LINE>What shipping and what lading&#8217;s in our haven,</LINE>
<LINE>And then return to us.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lords.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Helicanus, thou</LINE>
<LINE>Hast mov&#8217;d us. What seest thou in our looks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An angry brow, dread lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>If there be such a dart in princes&#8217; frowns,</LINE>
<LINE>How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dares the plants look up to heaven, from whence</LINE>
<LINE>They have their nourishment?</LINE>

<LINE>I have ground the axe myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Do but you strike the blow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rise, prithee rise. Sit down. Thou art</LINE>
<LINE>No flatterer. I thank thee for&#8217;t, and heaven forbid</LINE>
<LINE>That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid!</LINE>
<LINE>Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant,</LINE>
<LINE>What wouldst thou have me do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">To bear with patience</LINE>
<LINE>Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou speak&#8217;st like a physician, Helicanus,</LINE>
<LINE>That ministers a potion unto me</LINE>
<LINE>That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Attend me then: I went to Antioch,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, as thou know&#8217;st, against the face of death</LINE>
<LINE>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence an issue I might propagate,</LINE>
<LINE>Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.</LINE>
<LINE>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;</LINE>
<LINE>The rest (hark in thine ear) as black as incest,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father</LINE>
<LINE>Seem&#8217;d not to strike, but smooth. But thou know&#8217;st this,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>Which fear so grew in me, I hither fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the covering of a careful night,</LINE>
<LINE>Who seem&#8217;d my good protector, and being here,</LINE>
<LINE>Bethought what was past, what might succeed.</LINE>
<LINE>I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants&#8217; fears</LINE>
<LINE>Decrease not, but grow faster than the years;</LINE>
<LINE>And should he doubt &#8217;t, as no doubt he doth,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should open to the list&#8217;ning air</LINE>
<LINE>How many worthy princes&#8217; bloods were shed</LINE>
<LINE>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,</LINE>
<LINE>To lop that doubt, he&#8217;ll fill this land with arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;</LINE>
<LINE>When all, for mine, if I may call offense,</LINE>
<LINE>Must feel war&#8217;s blow, who spares not innocence:</LINE>
<LINE>Which love to all, of which thyself art one,</LINE>
<LINE>Who now reprov&#8217;dst me for&#8217;t&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts</LINE>
<LINE>How I might stop this tempest ere it came,</LINE>
<LINE>And finding little comfort to relieve them,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,</LINE>
<LINE>And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,</LINE>
<LINE>Who either by public war or private treason</LINE>
<LINE>Will take away your life.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that his rage and anger be forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.</LINE>
<LINE>Your rule direct to any; if to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Day serves not light more faithful than I&#8217;ll be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not doubt thy faith;</LINE>
<LINE>But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll mingle our bloods together in the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence we had our being and our birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tharsus</LINE>
<LINE>Intend my travel, where I&#8217;ll hear from thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And by whose letters I&#8217;ll dispose myself.</LINE>
<LINE>The care I had and have of subjects&#8217; good</LINE>
<LINE>On thee I lay, whose wisdom&#8217;s strength can bear it.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:</LINE>
<LINE>Who shuns not to break one will crack them both;</LINE>
<LINE>But in our orbs we&#8217;ll live so round and safe,</LINE>
<LINE>That time of both this truth shall ne&#8217;er convince,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hang&#8217;d at home. &#8217;Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desir&#8217;d he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for&#8217;t; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he&#8217;s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! here comes the lords of Tyre.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,</LINE>
<LINE>Took some displeasure at him, at lease he judg&#8217;d so;</LINE>
<LINE>And doubting lest he had err&#8217;d or sinn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To show his sorrow, he&#8217;d correct himself;</LINE>
<LINE>So puts himself unto the shipman&#8217;s toil,</LINE>
<LINE>With whom each minute threatens life or death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Well, I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not be hang&#8217;d now, although I would;</LINE>
<LINE>But since he&#8217;s gone, the King&#8217;s seas must please:</LINE>
<LINE>He scap&#8217;d the land to perish at the sea.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll present myself.&#8212;Peace to the lords of Tyre!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have no reason to desire it,</LINE>

<LINE>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it,</LINE>

<LINE>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</LINE>
<LINE>Here they are but felt, and seen with mischief&#8217;s eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>But like to groves, being topp&#8217;d, they higher rise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Dionyza!</LINE>
<LINE>Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it,</LINE>

<LINE>Our tongues and sorrows to sound deep our woes</LINE>
<LINE>Into the air, our eyes to weep, till tongues</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch breath that may proclaim them louder, that</LINE>
<LINE>If heaven slumber, while their creatures want,</LINE>
<LINE>They may awake their helpers to comfort them.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</LINE>

<LINE>This Tharsus, o&#8217;er which I have the government,</LINE>

<LINE>Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss&#8217;d the clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>And strangers ne&#8217;er beheld but wond&#8217;red at;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Like one another&#8217;s glass to trim them by;</LINE>
<LINE>Their tables were stor&#8217;d full, to glad the sight,</LINE>
<LINE>And not so much to feed on as delight;</LINE>
<LINE>All poverty was scorn&#8217;d, and pride so great,</LINE>
<LINE>The name of help grew odious to repeat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, &#8217;tis too true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But see what heaven can do by this our change:</LINE>
<LINE>These mouths who, but of late, earth, sea, and air</LINE>
<LINE>Were all too little to content and please,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</LINE>
<LINE>As houses are defil&#8217;d for want of use,</LINE>
<LINE>They are now starv&#8217;d for want of exercise;</LINE>
<LINE>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</LINE>
<LINE>Must have inventions to delight the taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Would now be glad of bread and beg for it;</LINE>
<LINE>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</LINE>
<LINE>To eat those little darlings whom they lov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>So sharp are hunger&#8217;s teeth, that man and wife</LINE>
<LINE>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.</LINE>
<LINE>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</LINE>
<LINE>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</LINE>
<LINE>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</LINE>

<LINE>We have descried, upon our neighboring shore,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought as much.</LINE>
<LINE>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir</LINE>
<LINE>That may succeed as his inheritor;</LINE>
<LINE>And so in ours, some neighboring nation,</LINE>
<LINE>Taking advantage of our misery,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath stuff&#8217;d the hollow vessels with their power</LINE>
<LINE>To beat us down, the which are down already,</LINE>

<LINE>Good Helicane, that stay&#8217;d at home,</LINE>

<LINE>And I (as fits my nature) do obey you.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,</LINE>
<LINE>Wash&#8217;d me from shore to shore, and left me breath</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing to think on but ensuing death.</LINE>
<LINE>Let it suffice the greatness of your powers</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, poor souls, it griev&#8217;d my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when, well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpas how he bounc&#8217;d and tumbled? They say they&#8217;re half fish, half flesh. A plague on them, they ne&#8217;er come but I look to be wash&#8217;d. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: &#8217;a plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devour them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on a&#8217; th&#8217; land, who never leave gaping till they swallow&#8217;d the whole parish, church, steeple, bells, and all.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because he should have swallow&#8217;d me too, and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and parish up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>With this strict charge, even as he left his life,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Keep it, my Pericles, it hath been a shield</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,</LINE>

<LINE>And that you&#8217;d guide me to your sovereign&#8217;s court,</LINE>
<LINE>Where with it I may appear a gentleman;</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, but hark you, my friend, &#8217;twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters. There are certain condolements, certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, You&#8217;ll remember from whence you had them.</LINE>

<LINE>Believe&#8217;t, I will.</LINE>

<LINE>It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express</LINE>
<LINE>My commendations great, whose merit&#8217;s less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It&#8217;s fit it should be so, for princes are</LINE>
<LINE>A model which heaven makes like to itself.</LINE>
<LINE>As jewels lose their glory if neglected,</LINE>
<LINE>So princes their renowns if not respected.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis now your honor, daughter, to entertain</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAI.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Sixth Knight, Pericles, as he passes by, himself presents his device to the Princess.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had need mean better than his outward show</LINE>
<LINE>Can any way speak in his just commend;</LINE>
<LINE>For by his rusty outside he appears</LINE>
<LINE>To have practic&#8217;d more the whipstock than the lance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He well may be a stranger, for he comes</LINE>
<LINE>To an honor&#8217;d triumph strangely furnished.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And on set purpose let his armor rust</LINE>
<LINE>Until this day, to scour it in the dust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Opinion&#8217;s but a fool, that makes us scan</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knights,</LINE>
<LINE>To say you&#8217;re welcome were superfluous.</LINE>
<LINE>To place upon the volume of your deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>As in a title-page, your worth in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Were more than you expect, or more than&#8217;s fit,</LINE>
<LINE>Since every worth in show commends itself.</LINE>

<LINE>You are princes and my guests.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Thaisa.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>He&#8217;s but a country gentleman:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Yon king&#8217;s to me like to my father&#8217;s picture,</LINE>
<LINE>Which tells me in that glory once he was;</LINE>
<LINE>Had princes sit like stars about his throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And he the sun for them to reverence;</LINE>
<LINE>None that beheld him but, like lesser lights,</LINE>
<LINE>Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now his son&#8217;s like a glow-worm in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby I see that Time&#8217;s the king of men,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s both their parent, and he is their grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>To me, my father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O, attend, my daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>Princes in this should live like gods above,</LINE>
<LINE>Who freely give to every one that come</LINE>
<LINE>To honor them;</LINE>
<LINE>And princes not doing so are like to gnats,</LINE>
<LINE>Which make a sound, but kill&#8217;d are wond&#8217;red at.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my father, it befits not me</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.</LINE>
<LINE>He may my proffer take for an offense,</LINE>

<LINE>Now by the gods, he could not please me better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now by the gods, I pity his misfortune,</LINE>
<LINE>And will awake him from his melancholy.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,</LINE>
<LINE>And waste the time, which looks for other revels.</LINE>
<LINE>Even in your armors, as you are address&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Will well become a soldier&#8217;s dance.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not have excuse with saying this,</LINE>
<LINE>Loud music is too harsh for ladies&#8217; heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Since they love men in arms as well as beds.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They dance.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, this was well ask&#8217;d, &#8217;twas so well perform&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sir, here&#8217;s a lady that wants breathing too,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrong not yourself then, noble Helicane;</LINE>
<LINE>But if the Prince do live, let us salute him,</LINE>
<LINE>Or know what ground&#8217;s made happy by his breath.</LINE>
<LINE>If in the world he live, we&#8217;ll seek him out;</LINE>
<LINE>If in his grave he rest, we&#8217;ll find him there;</LINE>
<LINE>And be resolved he lives to govern us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or dead, give &#8217;s cause to mourn his funeral,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave us to our free election.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose death indeed the strongest in our censure,</LINE>

<LINE>If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.</LINE>
<LINE>Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Where&#8217;s hourly trouble for a minute&#8217;s ease.</LINE>
<LINE>A twelvemonth longer let me entreat you</LINE>
<LINE>To forbear the absence of your king;</LINE>
<LINE>If in which time expir&#8217;d he not return,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, so well, that you must be her master,</LINE>
<LINE>And she will be your scholar; therefore look to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.</LINE>

<LINE>What&#8217;s here?</LINE>
<LINE>A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis the King&#8217;s subtilty to have my life.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>A stranger and distressed gentleman,</LINE>

<LINE>A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.</LINE>

<LINE>Now by the gods, I do applaud his courage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My actions are as noble as my thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>That never relish&#8217;d of a base descent.</LINE>
<LINE>I came unto your court for honor&#8217;s cause,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAI.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>At that would make me glad?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I am glad on&#8217;t with all my heart.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tame you; I&#8217;ll bring you in subjection.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you, not having my consent,</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">who, for aught I know,</LINE>
<LINE>May be (nor can I think the contrary)</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore hear you, mistress, either frame</LINE>
<LINE>Your will to mine&#8212;and you, sir, hear you&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Now sleep yslacked hath the rout,</LINE>
<LINE>No din but snores the house about,</LINE>
<LINE>Made louder by the o&#8217;erfed breast</LINE>
<LINE>Of this most pompous marriage-feast.</LINE>
<LINE>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</LINE>
<LINE>Now couches from the mouse&#8217;s hole;</LINE>
<LINE>And crickets sing at the oven&#8217;s mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Are the blither for their drouth.</LINE>
<LINE>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</LINE>
<LINE>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</LINE>
<LINE>And time that is so briefly spent</LINE>
<LINE>With your fine fancies quaintly eche:</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s dumb in show I&#8217;ll plain with speech.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Dumb Show.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Pericles and Simonides, at one door, with Attendants. A Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter Thaisa with child, with Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter; she rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By many a dern and painful perch,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Pericles the careful search,</LINE>
<LINE>By the four opposing coigns</LINE>
<LINE>Which the world together joins,</LINE>
<LINE>Is made with all due diligence</LINE>
<LINE>That horse and sail and high expense</LINE>
<LINE>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; court of King Simonides</LINE>
<LINE>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</LINE>
<LINE>Antiochus and his daughter dead,</LINE>
<LINE>The men of Tyrus on the head</LINE>
<LINE>Of Helicanus would set on</LINE>
<LINE>The crown of Tyre, but he will none.</LINE>
<LINE>The mutiny he there hastes t&#8217; oppress,</LINE>
<LINE>Says to &#8217;em, if King Pericles</LINE>
<LINE>Come not home in twice six moons,</LINE>
<LINE>He, obedient to their dooms,</LINE>
<LINE>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</LINE>
<LINE>Yravished the regions round,</LINE>
<LINE>And every one with claps can sound,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Our heir-apparent is a king!</LINE>
<LINE>Who dreamt? who thought of such a thing?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</LINE>
<LINE>His queen, with child, makes her desire&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Which who shall cross?&#8212;along to go.</LINE>
<LINE>Omit we all their dole and woe.</LINE>
<LINE>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</LINE>
<LINE>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</LINE>
<LINE>On Neptune&#8217;s billow; half the flood</LINE>
<LINE>Hath their keel cut. But fortune, mov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Varies again; the grisled north</LINE>
<LINE>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as a duck for life that dives,</LINE>
<LINE>So up and down the poor ship drives.</LINE>
<LINE>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</LINE>
<LINE>Does fall in travail with her fear;</LINE>
<LINE>And what ensues in this fell storm</LINE>
<LINE>Shall for itself itself perform.</LINE>
<LINE>I nill relate, action may</LINE>
<LINE>Conveniently the rest convey,</LINE>
<LINE>Which might not what by me is told.</LINE>

<LINE>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</LINE>

<LINE>In music&#8217;s letters, who hath gain&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of education all the grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes her both th&#8217; heart and place</LINE>
<LINE>Of general wonder. But alack,</LINE>
<LINE>That monster Envy, oft the wrack</LINE>
<LINE>Of earned praise, Marina&#8217;s life</LINE>
<LINE>Seeks to take off by treason&#8217;s knife,</LINE>

<LINE>For certain in our story, she</LINE>

<LINE>She would with rich and constant pen</LINE>

<LINE>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, &#8217;twere not amiss to keep our door hatch&#8217;d. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving o&#8217;er.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Marina.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Pray you come hither a while. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.

<LINE>That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,</LINE>

<LINE>Virtue preserv&#8217;d from fell destruction&#8217;s blast,</LINE>
<LINE>Led on by heaven, and crown&#8217;d with joy at last.</LINE>
<LINE>In Helicanus may you well descry</LINE>
<LINE>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.</LINE>
<LINE>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</LINE>
<LINE>The worth that learned charity aye wears.</LINE>
<LINE>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</LINE>
<LINE>Had spread his cursed deed, the honor&#8217;d name</LINE>
<LINE>Of Pericles to rage the city turn,</LINE>
<LINE>That him and his they in his palace burn;</LINE>
<LINE>The gods for murder seemed so content</LINE>
<LINE>To punish, although not done, but meant.</LINE>
<LINE>So, on your patience evermore attending,</LINE>
<LINE>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</LINE>
