<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>1</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</LINE>
<LINE>That thereby beauty&#8217;s rose might never die,</LINE>
<LINE>But as the riper should by time decease,</LINE>
<LINE>His tender heir might bear his memory:</LINE>
<LINE>But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Feed&#8217;st thy light&#8217;s flame with self-substantial fuel,</LINE>
<LINE>Making a famine where abundance lies,</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that art now the world&#8217;s fresh ornament,</LINE>
<LINE>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</LINE>
<LINE>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</LINE>
<LINE>And, tender chorl, mak&#8217;st waste in niggarding:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To eat the world&#8217;s due, by the grave and thee.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>2</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</LINE>
<LINE>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#8217;s field,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy youth&#8217;s proud livery, so gaz&#8217;d on now,</LINE>
<LINE>Will be a totter&#8217;d weed of small worth held:</LINE>
<LINE>Then being ask&#8217;d, where all thy beauty lies,</LINE>
<LINE>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,</LINE>
<LINE>To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</LINE>
<LINE>How much more praise deserv&#8217;d thy beauty&#8217;s use,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou couldst answer,  &#8220;This fair child of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Proving his beauty by succession thine.</LINE>
<COUPLET>This were to be new made when thou art old,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#8217;st it cold.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>3</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the time that face should form another,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</LINE>
<LINE>For where is she so fair whose unear&#8217;d womb</LINE>
<LINE>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</LINE>
<LINE>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>Of his self-love, to stop posterity?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art thy mother&#8217;s glass, and she in thee</LINE>
<LINE>Calls back the lovely April of her prime,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.</LINE>
<COUPLET>But if thou live rememb&#8217;red not to be,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>4</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thyself thy beauty&#8217;s legacy?</LINE>
<LINE>Nature&#8217;s bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,</LINE>
<LINE>And being frank she lends to those are free:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse</LINE>
<LINE>The bounteous largess given thee to give?</LINE>
<LINE>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use</LINE>
<LINE>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?</LINE>
<LINE>For having traffic with thyself alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,</LINE>
<LINE>Then how when Nature calls thee to be gone,</LINE>
<LINE>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Thy unus&#8217;d beauty must be tomb&#8217;d with thee,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Which used lives th&#8217; executor to be.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>5</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Those hours that with gentle work did frame</LINE>
<LINE>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell</LINE>
<LINE>Will play the tyrants to the very same,</LINE>
<LINE>And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</LINE>
<LINE>For never-resting time leads summer on</LINE>
<LINE>To hideous winter and confounds him there,</LINE>
<LINE>Sap check&#8217;d with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty o&#8217;ersnow&#8217;d and bareness every where:</LINE>
<LINE>Then were not summer&#8217;s distillation left</LINE>
<LINE>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty&#8217;s effect with beauty were bereft,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</LINE>
<COUPLET>But flowers distill&#8217;d, though they with winter meet,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>6</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Then let not winter&#8217;s ragged hand deface</LINE>
<LINE>In thee thy summer ere thou be distill&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place</LINE>
<LINE>With beauty&#8217;s treasure ere it be self-kill&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>That use is not forbidden usury,</LINE>
<LINE>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s for thyself to breed another thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Or ten times happier be it ten for one;</LINE>
<LINE>Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>If ten of thine ten times refigur&#8217;d thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving thee living in posterity?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Be not self-will&#8217;d, for thou art much too fair</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To be death&#8217;s conquest and make worms thine heir.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>7</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Lo in the orient when the gracious light</LINE>
<LINE>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</LINE>
<LINE>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Serving with looks his sacred majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>And having climb&#8217;d the steep-up heavenly hill,</LINE>
<LINE>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</LINE>
<LINE>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</LINE>
<LINE>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</LINE>
<LINE>Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,</LINE>
<LINE>The eyes (&#8217;fore duteous) now converted are</LINE>
<LINE>From his low tract and look another way:</LINE>
<COUPLET>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Unlook&#8217;d on diest unless thou get a son.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>8</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Music to hear, why hear&#8217;st thou music sadly?</LINE>
<LINE>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.</LINE>
<LINE>Why lov&#8217;st thou that which thou receiv&#8217;st not gladly,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else receiv&#8217;st with pleasure thine annoy?</LINE>
<LINE>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</LINE>
<LINE>By unions married, do offend thine ear,</LINE>
<LINE>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</LINE>
<LINE>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.</LINE>
<LINE>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</LINE>
<LINE>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</LINE>
<LINE>Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Sings this to thee,  &#8220;Thou single wilt prove none.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>9</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Is it for fear to wet a widow&#8217;s eye</LINE>
<LINE>That thou consum&#8217;st thyself in single life?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,</LINE>
<LINE>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,</LINE>
<LINE>The world will be thy widow and still weep,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</LINE>
<LINE>When every private widow well may keep,</LINE>
<LINE>By children&#8217;s eyes, her husband&#8217;s shape in mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend</LINE>
<LINE>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it,</LINE>
<LINE>But beauty&#8217;s waste hath in the world an end,</LINE>
<LINE>And kept unus&#8217;d, the user so destroys it:</LINE>
<COUPLET>No love toward others in that bosom sits</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That on himself such murd&#8217;rous shame commits.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>10</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>For shame deny that thou bear&#8217;st love to any,</LINE>
<LINE>Who for thyself art so unprovident.</LINE>
<LINE>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov&#8217;d of many,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thou none lov&#8217;st is most evident;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou art so possess&#8217;d with murd&#8217;rous hate,</LINE>
<LINE>That &#8217;gainst thyself thou stick&#8217;st not to conspire,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</LINE>
<LINE>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</LINE>
<LINE>O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall hate be fairer lodg&#8217;d than gentle love?</LINE>
<LINE>Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Make thee another self for love of me,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>


<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>11</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>In one of thine, from that which thou departest,</LINE>
<LINE>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest.</LINE>
<LINE>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,</LINE>
<LINE>Without this, folly, age, and cold decay.</LINE>
<LINE>If all were minded so, the times should cease,</LINE>
<LINE>And threescore year would make the world away.</LINE>
<LINE>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</LINE>
<LINE>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</LINE>
<LINE>Look whom she best endow&#8217;d she gave the more;</LINE>
<LINE>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.</LINE>
<COUPLET>She carv&#8217;d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>12</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>When I do count the clock that tells the time,</LINE>
<LINE>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</LINE>
<LINE>When I behold the violet past prime,</LINE>
<LINE>And sable curls all silver&#8217;d o&#8217;er with white;</LINE>
<LINE>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</LINE>
<LINE>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</LINE>
<LINE>And summer&#8217;s green all girded up in sheaves</LINE>
<LINE>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:</LINE>
<LINE>Then of thy beauty do I question make</LINE>
<LINE>That thou among the wastes of time must go,</LINE>
<LINE>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,</LINE>
<LINE>And die as fast as they see others grow,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And nothing &#8217;gainst Time&#8217;s scythe can make defense</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>13</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>O that you were yourself! but, love, you are</LINE>
<LINE>No longer yours than you yourself here live:</LINE>
<LINE>Against this coming end you should prepare,</LINE>
<LINE>And your sweet semblance to some other give.</LINE>
<LINE>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</LINE>
<LINE>Find no determination; then you were</LINE>
<LINE>Yourself again after yourself&#8217;s decease,</LINE>
<LINE>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</LINE>
<LINE>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</LINE>
<LINE>Which husbandry in honor might uphold</LINE>
<LINE>Against the stormy gusts of winter&#8217;s day</LINE>
<LINE>And barren rage of death&#8217;s eternal cold?</LINE>
<COUPLET>O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>You had a father, let your son say so.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>14</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet methinks I have astronomy,</LINE>
<LINE>But not to tell of good or evil luck,</LINE>
<LINE>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#8217; quality;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Or say with princes if it shall go well</LINE>
<LINE>By oft predict that I in heaven find.</LINE>
<LINE>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</LINE>
<LINE>And, constant stars, in them I read such art</LINE>
<LINE>As truth and beauty shall together thrive</LINE>
<LINE>If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Or else of thee this I prognosticate,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Thy end is truth&#8217;s and beauty&#8217;s doom and date.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>15</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>When I consider every thing that grows</LINE>
<LINE>Holds in perfection but a little moment;</LINE>
<LINE>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</LINE>
<LINE>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</LINE>
<LINE>Cheered and check&#8217;d even by the self-same sky,</LINE>
<LINE>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</LINE>
<LINE>And wear their brave state out of memory:</LINE>
<LINE>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</LINE>
<LINE>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay</LINE>
<LINE>To change your day of youth to sullied night,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And all in war with Time for love of you,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>16</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>But wherefore do not you a mightier way</LINE>
<LINE>Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?</LINE>
<LINE>And fortify yourself in your decay</LINE>
<LINE>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</LINE>
<LINE>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</LINE>
<LINE>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,</LINE>
<LINE>With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,</LINE>
<LINE>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</LINE>
<LINE>So should the lines of life that life repair</LINE>
<LINE>Which this time&#8217;s pencil, or my pupil pen,</LINE>
<LINE>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair</LINE>
<LINE>Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.</LINE>
<COUPLET>To give away yourself keeps yourself still,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>17</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Who will believe my verse in time to come</LINE>
<LINE>If it were fill&#8217;d with your most high deserts?</LINE>
<LINE>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</LINE>
<LINE>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.</LINE>
<LINE>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</LINE>
<LINE>The age to come would say, &#8220;This poet lies,</LINE>
<LINE>Such heavenly touches ne&#8217;er touch&#8217;d earthly faces.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>So should my papers (yellowed with their age)</LINE>
<LINE>Be scorn&#8217;d, like old men of less truth than tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>And your true rights be term&#8217;d a poet&#8217;s rage,</LINE>
<LINE>And stretched metre of an antique song:</LINE>
<COUPLET>But were some child of yours alive that time,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>18</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Shall I compare thee to a summer&#8217;s day?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</LINE>
<LINE>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</LINE>
<LINE>And summer&#8217;s lease hath all too short a date;</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</LINE>
<LINE>And often is his gold complexion dimm&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</LINE>
<LINE>By chance or nature&#8217;s changing course untrimm&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall Death brag thou wand&#8217;rest in his shade,</LINE>
<LINE>When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#8217;st.</LINE>
<COUPLET>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</COUPLET>
</SONNET>

<SONNET>
<SONNETNUM>19</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion&#8217;s paws,</LINE>
<LINE>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#8217;s jaws,</LINE>
<LINE>And burn the long-liv&#8217;d phoenix in her blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>And do what e&#8217;er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</LINE>
<LINE>To the wide world and all her fading sweets:</LINE>
<LINE>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,</LINE>
<LINE>O, carve not with thy hours my love&#8217;s fair brow,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;</LINE>
<LINE>Him in thy course untainted do allow,</LINE>
<LINE>For beauty&#8217;s pattern to succeeding men.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Yet do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>My love shall in my verse ever live young.</COUPLET>

<SONNETNUM>20</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>A woman&#8217;s face with Nature&#8217;s own hand painted</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;</LINE>
<LINE>A woman&#8217;s gentle heart but not acquainted</LINE>
<LINE>With shifting change as is false women&#8217;s fashion;</LINE>
<LINE>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</LINE>
<LINE>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</LINE>
<LINE>A man in hue all hues in his controlling,</LINE>
<LINE>Which steals men&#8217;s eyes and women&#8217;s souls amazeth.</LINE>
<LINE>And for a woman wert thou first created,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,</LINE>
<LINE>And by addition me of thee defeated,</LINE>
<LINE>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</LINE>
<COUPLET>But since she prick&#8217;d thee out for women&#8217;s pleasure,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Mine be thy love, and thy love&#8217;s use their treasure.</COUPLET>

<LINE>So is it not with me as with that Muse</LINE>
<LINE>Stirr&#8217;d by a painted beauty to his verse,</LINE>
<LINE>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use,</LINE>
<LINE>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</LINE>
<LINE>Making a couplement of proud compare</LINE>
<LINE>With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#8217;s rich gems,</LINE>
<LINE>With April&#8217;s first-born flowers, and all things rare</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven&#8217;s air in this huge rondure hems.</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me, true in love, but truly write,</LINE>
<LINE>And then believe me, my love is as fair</LINE>
<LINE>As any mother&#8217;s child, though not so bright</LINE>
<LINE>As those gold candles fix&#8217;d in heaven&#8217;s air:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Let them say more that like of hearsay well,</COUPLET>

<LINE>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</LINE>
<LINE>So long as youth and thou are of one date,</LINE>
<LINE>But when in thee time&#8217;s furrows I behold,</LINE>
<LINE>Then look I death my days should expiate.</LINE>
<LINE>For all that beauty that doth cover thee</LINE>
<LINE>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</LINE>
<LINE>How can I then be elder than thou art?</LINE>
<LINE>O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary</LINE>
<LINE>As I, not for myself, but for thee will,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</LINE>
<LINE>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Thou gav&#8217;st me thine not to give back again.</COUPLET>

<SONNETNUM>23</SONNETNUM>
<LINE>As an unperfect actor on the stage,</LINE>
<LINE>Who with his fear is put besides his part,</LINE>
<LINE>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose strength&#8217;s abundance weakens his own heart,</LINE>
<LINE>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</LINE>
<LINE>The perfect ceremony of love&#8217;s rite,</LINE>
<LINE>And in mine own love&#8217;s strength seem to decay,</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;ercharg&#8217;d with burden of mine own love&#8217;s might.</LINE>
<LINE>O, let my books be then the eloquence</LINE>
<LINE>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</LINE>
<LINE>More than that tongue that more hath more express&#8217;d.</LINE>
<COUPLET>O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To hear with eyes belongs to love&#8217;s fine wit.</COUPLET>

<LINE>Mine eye hath play&#8217;d the painter and hath stell&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Thy beauty&#8217;s form in table of my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>My body is the frame wherein &#8217;tis held,</LINE>
<LINE>And perspective it is best painter&#8217;s art.</LINE>
<LINE>For through the painter must you see his skill,</LINE>
<LINE>To find where your true image pictur&#8217;d lies,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in my bosom&#8217;s shop is hanging still,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</LINE>
<LINE>Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun</LINE>
<LINE>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</COUPLET>

<LINE>Let those who are in favor with their stars</LINE>
<LINE>Of public honor and proud titles boast,</LINE>

<LINE>Unlook&#8217;d for joy in that I honor most.</LINE>
<LINE>Great princes&#8217; favorites their fair leaves spread</LINE>
<LINE>But as the marigold at the sun&#8217;s eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And in themselves their pride lies buried,</LINE>
<LINE>For at a frown they in their glory die.</LINE>
<LINE>The painful warrior famoused for fight,</LINE>
<LINE>After a thousand victories once foil&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Is from the book of honor rased quite,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the rest forgot for which he toil&#8217;d.</LINE>

<LINE>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage</LINE>

<LINE>To witness duty, not to show my wit;</LINE>
<LINE>Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</LINE>
<LINE>May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,</LINE>
<LINE>But that I hope some good conceit of thine</LINE>
<LINE>In thy soul&#8217;s thought (all naked) will bestow it;</LINE>
<LINE>Till whatsoever star that guides my moving</LINE>
<LINE>Points on me graciously with fair aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>And puts apparel on my tottered loving,</LINE>
