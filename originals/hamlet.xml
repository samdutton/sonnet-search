<SPEECH>

<LINE>Horatio says &#8217;tis but our fantasy,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not let belief take hold of him</LINE>
<LINE>Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I have entreated him along,</LINE>
<LINE>With us to watch the minutes of this night,</LINE>
<LINE>That if again this apparition come,</LINE>
<LINE>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</LINE>

<LINE>Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again!</LINE>

<LINE>Looks &#8217;a not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most like; it harrows me with fear and wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>It would be spoke to.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What art thou that usurp&#8217;st this time of night,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with that fair and warlike form</LINE>
<LINE>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</LINE>
<LINE>Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Horatio? you tremble and look pale.</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this something more than fantasy?</LINE>
<LINE>What think you on&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before my God, I might not this believe</LINE>
<LINE>Without the sensible and true avouch</LINE>
<LINE>Of mine own eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Is it not like the King?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou art to thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Such was the very armor he had on</LINE>
<LINE>When he the ambitious Norway combated.</LINE>
<LINE>So frown&#8217;d he once when in an angry parle</LINE>
<LINE>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</LINE>
<LINE>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what particular thought to work I know not,</LINE>
<LINE>But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</LINE>
<LINE>Why this same strict and most observant watch</LINE>
<LINE>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</LINE>
<LINE>And foreign mart for implements of war,</LINE>
<LINE>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</LINE>
<LINE>Does not divide the Sunday from the week,</LINE>
<LINE>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day:</LINE>
<LINE>Who is&#8217;t that can inform me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">That can I,</LINE>
<LINE>At least the whisper goes so: our last king,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose image even but now appear&#8217;d to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</LINE>
<LINE>Thereto prick&#8217;d on by a most emulate pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Dar&#8217;d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</LINE>
<LINE>(For so this side of our known world esteem&#8217;d him)</LINE>
<LINE>Did slay this Fortinbras, who, by a seal&#8217;d compact</LINE>
<LINE>Well ratified by law and heraldy,</LINE>
<LINE>Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands</LINE>
<LINE>Which he stood seiz&#8217;d of, to the conqueror;</LINE>
<LINE>Against the which a moi&#8217;ty competent</LINE>
<LINE>Was gaged by our king, which had return&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Had he been vanquisher; as by the same comart</LINE>
<LINE>And carriage of the article design&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</LINE>
<LINE>Shark&#8217;d up a list of lawless resolutes</LINE>
<LINE>For food and diet to some enterprise</LINE>
<LINE>That hath a stomach in&#8217;t, which is no other,</LINE>
<LINE>As it doth well appear unto our state,</LINE>
<LINE>But to recover of us, by strong hand</LINE>
<LINE>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</LINE>
<LINE>So by his father lost; and this, I take it,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the main motive of our preparations,</LINE>
<LINE>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</LINE>
<LINE>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be no other but e&#8217;en so.</LINE>
<LINE>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</LINE>
<LINE>Comes armed through our watch so like the King</LINE>
<LINE>That was and is the question of these wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A mote it is to trouble the mind&#8217;s eye.</LINE>
<LINE>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</LINE>
<LINE>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</LINE>
<LINE>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.</LINE>
<LINE>As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose influence Neptune&#8217;s empire stands</LINE>
<LINE>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</LINE>
<LINE>And even the like precurse of fear&#8217;d events,</LINE>
<LINE>As harbingers preceding still the fates</LINE>
<LINE>And prologue to the omen coming on,</LINE>
<LINE>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</LINE>
<LINE>Unto our climatures and countrymen.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ghost.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>But soft, behold! lo where it comes again!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>It spreads his arms.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll cross it though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hast any sound or use of voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me.</LINE>
<LINE>If there be any good thing to be done</LINE>
<LINE>That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou art privy to thy country&#8217;s fate,</LINE>
<LINE>Which happily foreknowing may avoid,</LINE>
<LINE>O speak!</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</LINE>
<LINE>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</LINE>
<LINE>For which, they say, your spirits oft walk in death,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak of it, stay and speak!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The cock crows.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Stop it, Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I strike it with my partisan?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, if it will not stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">&#8217;Tis here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis gone!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>To offer it the show of violence,</LINE>
<LINE>For it is as the air, invulnerable,</LINE>
<LINE>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was about to speak when the cock crew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then it started like a guilty thing</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard</LINE>
<LINE>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the god of day, and at his warning,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; extravagant and erring spirit hies</LINE>
<LINE>To his confine; and of the truth herein</LINE>
<LINE>This present object made probation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say that ever &#8217;gainst that season comes</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein our Saviour&#8217;s birth is celebrated,</LINE>
<LINE>This bird of dawning singeth all night long,</LINE>
<LINE>And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</LINE>
<LINE>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</LINE>
<LINE>So hallowed, and so gracious, is that time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</LINE>
<LINE>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad</LINE>
<LINE>Walks o&#8217;er the dew of yon high eastward hill.</LINE>
<LINE>Break we our watch up, and by my advice</LINE>
<LINE>Let us impart what we have seen tonight</LINE>
<LINE>Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,</LINE>
<LINE>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</LINE>
<LINE>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s do&#8217;t, I pray, and I this morning know</LINE>
<LINE>Where we shall find him most convenient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen; Council: as Polonius; and his son Laertes, Hamlet, cum aliis including Voltemand and Cornelius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&#8217;s death</LINE>
<LINE>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</LINE>
<LINE>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom</LINE>
<LINE>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</LINE>
<LINE>That we with wisest sorrow think on him</LINE>
<LINE>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; imperial jointress to this warlike state,</LINE>
<LINE>Have we, as &#8217;twere with a defeated joy,</LINE>
<LINE>With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,</LINE>
<LINE>With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,</LINE>
<LINE>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</LINE>
<LINE>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</LINE>
<LINE>Now follows that you know young Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thinking by our late dear brother&#8217;s death</LINE>
<LINE>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</LINE>
<LINE>Co-leagued with this dream of his advantage,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath not fail&#8217;d to pester us with message</LINE>
<LINE>Importing the surrender of those lands</LINE>
<LINE>Lost by his father, with all bands of law,</LINE>
<LINE>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</LINE>
<LINE>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, impotent and bedred, scarcely hears</LINE>
<LINE>Of this his nephew&#8217;s purpose&#8212;to suppress</LINE>
<LINE>His further gait herein, in that the levies,</LINE>
<LINE>The lists, and full proportions are all made</LINE>
<LINE>Out of his subject; and we here dispatch</LINE>
<LINE>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,</LINE>
<LINE>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving to you no further personal power</LINE>
<LINE>To business with the King, more than the scope</LINE>
<LINE>Of these delated articles allow.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Giving a paper.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR., VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In that, and all things, will we show our duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We doubt it nothing; heartily farewell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>And now, Laertes, what&#8217;s the news with you?</LINE>
<LINE>You told us of some suit, what is&#8217;t, Laertes?</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane</LINE>
<LINE>And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</LINE>
<LINE>The head is not more native to the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</LINE>
<LINE>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">My dread lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Your leave and favor to return to France,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark</LINE>
<LINE>To show my duty in your coronation,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet now I must confess, that duty done,</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,</LINE>
<LINE>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you your father&#8217;s leave? What says Polonius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>H&#8217;ath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</LINE>
<LINE>By laborsome petition, and at last</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his will I seal&#8217;d my hard consent.</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech you give him leave to go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take thy fair hour, Laertes, time be thine,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</LINE>
<LINE>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A little more than kin, and less than kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,</LINE>
<LINE>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</LINE>
<LINE>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</LINE>
<LINE>Seek for thy noble father in the dust.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know&#8217;st &#8217;tis common, all that lives must die,</LINE>
<LINE>Passing through nature to eternity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, it is common.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">If it be,</LINE>
<LINE>Why seems it so particular with thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seems, madam? nay, it is, I know not &#8220;seems.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor windy suspiration of forc&#8217;d breath,</LINE>
<LINE>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the dejected havior of the visage,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</LINE>
<LINE>That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,</LINE>
<LINE>For they are actions that a man might play,</LINE>
<LINE>But I have that within which passes show,</LINE>
<LINE>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>To give these mourning duties to your father.</LINE>
<LINE>But you must know your father lost a father,</LINE>
<LINE>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</LINE>
<LINE>In filial obligation for some term</LINE>
<LINE>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever</LINE>
<LINE>In obstinate condolement is a course</LINE>
<LINE>Of impious stubbornness, &#8217;tis unmanly grief,</LINE>
<LINE>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>A heart unfortified, or mind impatient,</LINE>
<LINE>An understanding simple and unschool&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>For what we know must be, and is as common</LINE>
<LINE>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</LINE>
<LINE>Why should we in our peevish opposition</LINE>
<LINE>Take it to heart? Fie, &#8217;tis a fault to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</LINE>
<LINE>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</LINE>
<LINE>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</LINE>
<LINE>From the first corse till he that died today,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;This must be so.&#8221; We pray you throw to earth</LINE>
<LINE>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</LINE>
<LINE>As of a father, for let the world take note</LINE>
<LINE>You are the most immediate to our throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And with no less nobility of love</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which dearest father bears his son</LINE>
<LINE>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</LINE>
<LINE>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</LINE>
<LINE>It is most retrograde to our desire,</LINE>
<LINE>And we beseech you bend you to remain</LINE>
<LINE>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</LINE>

<LINE>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis a loving and a fair reply.</LINE>
<LINE>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.</LINE>
<LINE>This gentle and unforc&#8217;d accord of Hamlet</LINE>
<LINE>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof,</LINE>
<LINE>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today,</LINE>
<LINE>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</LINE>
<LINE>And the King&#8217;s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,</LINE>
<LINE>Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that this too too solid flesh would melt,</LINE>
<LINE>Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!</LINE>
<LINE>Or that the Everlasting had not fix&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>His canon &#8217;gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,</LINE>
<LINE>How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</LINE>
<LINE>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</LINE>
<LINE>Fie on&#8217;t, ah fie! &#8217;tis an unweeded garden</LINE>
<LINE>That grows to seed, things rank and gross in nature</LINE>
<LINE>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</LINE>
<LINE>But two months dead, nay, not so much, not two.</LINE>
<LINE>So excellent a king, that was to this</LINE>
<LINE>Hyperion to a satyr, so loving to my mother</LINE>
<LINE>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Must I remember? Why, she should hang on him</LINE>
<LINE>As if increase of appetite had grown</LINE>
<LINE>By what it fed on, and yet, within a month&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not think on&#8217;t! Frailty, thy name is woman!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</LINE>
<LINE>With which she followed my poor father&#8217;s body,</LINE>
<LINE>Like Niobe, all tears&#8212;why, she, even she&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason</LINE>
<LINE>Would have mourn&#8217;d longer&#8212;married with my uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>My father&#8217;s brother, but no more like my father</LINE>
<LINE>Than I to Hercules. Within a month,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</LINE>
<LINE>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>She married&#8212;O most wicked speed: to post</LINE>
<LINE>With such dexterity to incestious sheets,</LINE>
<LINE>It is not, nor it cannot come to good,</LINE>
<LINE>But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not hear your enemy say so,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall you do my ear that violence</LINE>
<LINE>To make it truster of your own report</LINE>
<LINE>Against yourself. I know you are no truant.</LINE>
<LINE>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I came to see your father&#8217;s funeral.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Thrift, thrift, Horatio, the funeral bak&#8217;d-meats</LINE>

<LINE>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</LINE>
<LINE>My father&#8212;methinks I see my father.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>&#8217;A was a man, take him for all in all,</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw, who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the King your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">The King my father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Season your admiration for a while</LINE>
<LINE>With an attent ear, till I may deliver,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>This marvel to you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">For God&#8217;s love let me hear!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,</LINE>
<LINE>In the dead waste and middle of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Been thus encount&#8217;red: a figure like your father,</LINE>
<LINE>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</LINE>
<LINE>Appears before them, and with solemn march</LINE>
<LINE>Goes slow and stately by them; thrice he walk&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By their oppress&#8217;d and fear-surprised eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Within his truncheon&#8217;s length, whilst they, distill&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</LINE>
<LINE>In dreadful secrecy impart they did,</LINE>
<LINE>And I with them the third night kept the watch,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, as they had delivered, both in time,</LINE>
<LINE>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</LINE>
<LINE>The apparition comes. I knew your father,</LINE>
<LINE>These hands are not more like.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">But where was this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My lord, upon the platform where we watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you not speak to it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My lord, I did,</LINE>
<LINE>But answer made it none. Yet once methought</LINE>
<LINE>It lifted up it head and did address</LINE>
<LINE>Itself to motion like as it would speak;</LINE>
<LINE>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</LINE>
<LINE>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away</LINE>
<LINE>And vanish&#8217;d from our sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">&#8217;Tis very strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I do live, my honor&#8217;d lord, &#8217;tis true,</LINE>
<LINE>And we did think it writ down in our duty</LINE>
<LINE>To let you know of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.</LINE>

<LINE>O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, look&#8217;d he frowningly?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My necessaries are inbark&#8217;d. Farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</LINE>
<LINE>And convey is assistant, do not sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>But let me hear from you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Do you doubt that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</LINE>
<LINE>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</LINE>
<LINE>The perfume and suppliance of a minute&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>No more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">No more but so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Think it no more:</LINE>
<LINE>For nature crescent does not grow alone</LINE>
<LINE>In thews and bulk, but as this temple waxes,</LINE>
<LINE>The inward service of the mind and soul</LINE>
<LINE>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</LINE>
<LINE>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</LINE>
<LINE>The virtue of his will, but you must fear,</LINE>
<LINE>His greatness weigh&#8217;d, his will is not his own,</LINE>
<LINE>For he himself is subject to his birth:</LINE>
<LINE>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</LINE>
<LINE>Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</LINE>
<LINE>The safety and health of this whole state,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore must his choice be circumscrib&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</LINE>
<LINE>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</LINE>
<LINE>As he in his particular act and place</LINE>
<LINE>May give his saying deed, which is no further</LINE>
<LINE>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain</LINE>
<LINE>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</LINE>
<LINE>To his unmast&#8217;red importunity.</LINE>
<LINE>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</LINE>
<LINE>The chariest maid is prodigal enough</LINE>
<LINE>If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes.</LINE>
<LINE>The canker galls the infants of the spring</LINE>
<LINE>Too oft before their buttons be disclos&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</LINE>
<LINE>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</LINE>
<LINE>Be wary then, best safety lies in fear:</LINE>
<LINE>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep</LINE>
<LINE>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</LINE>
<LINE>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles, like a puff&#8217;d and reckless libertine,</LINE>
<LINE>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</LINE>
<LINE>And reaks not his own rede.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Laying his hand on Laertes&#8217; head.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>My blessing with thee!</LINE>
<LINE>And these few precepts in thy memory</LINE>
<LINE>Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor any unproportion&#8217;d thought his act.</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:</LINE>
<LINE>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</LINE>
<LINE>Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>Of each new-hatch&#8217;d, unfledg&#8217;d courage. Beware</LINE>
<LINE>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</LINE>
<LINE>Bear&#8217;t that th&#8217; opposed may beware of thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Take each man&#8217;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.</LINE>
<LINE>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</LINE>
<LINE>But not express&#8217;d in fancy, rich, not gaudy,</LINE>
<LINE>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</LINE>
<LINE>And they in France of the best rank and station</LINE>
<LINE>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</LINE>
<LINE>Neither a borrower nor a lender be,</LINE>
<LINE>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And borrowing dulleth th&#8217; edge of husbandry.</LINE>
<LINE>This above all: to thine own self be true,</LINE>
<LINE>And it must follow, as the night the day,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, well bethought.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</LINE>
<LINE>Given private time to you, and you yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so&#8212;as so &#8217;tis put on me,</LINE>
<LINE>And that in way of caution&#8212;I must tell you,</LINE>
<LINE>You do not understand yourself so clearly</LINE>
<LINE>As it behooves my daughter and your honor.</LINE>
<LINE>What is between you? Give me up the truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</LINE>
<LINE>Of his affection to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Affection, puh! You speak like a green girl,</LINE>
<LINE>Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I will teach you: think yourself a baby</LINE>
<LINE>That you have ta&#8217;en these tenders for true pay,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,</LINE>
<LINE>Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</LINE>
<LINE>Wringing it thus) You&#8217;ll tender me a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, he hath importun&#8217;d me with love</LINE>
<LINE>In honorable fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</LINE>
<LINE>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</LINE>
<LINE>Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both</LINE>
<LINE>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</LINE>
<LINE>You must not take for fire. From this time</LINE>
<LINE>Be something scanter of your maiden presence,</LINE>
<LINE>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</LINE>
<LINE>Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>Believe so much in him, that he is young,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a larger teder may he walk</LINE>
<LINE>Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,</LINE>
<LINE>Not of that dye which their investments show,</LINE>
<LINE>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,</LINE>
<LINE>The better to beguile. This is for all:</LINE>
<LINE>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth</LINE>
<LINE>Have you so slander any moment leisure</LINE>
<LINE>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</LINE>
<LINE>Look to&#8217;t, I charge you. Come your ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I shall obey, my lord.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The air bites shrowdly, it is very cold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a nipping and an eager air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What hour now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">I think it lacks of twelf.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, it is strook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces goes off within.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>What does this mean, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,</LINE>
<LINE>Keeps wassail, and the swagg&#8217;ring up-spring reels;</LINE>
<LINE>And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</LINE>
<LINE>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</LINE>
<LINE>The triumph of his pledge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Is it a custom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, is&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>But to my mind, though I am native here</LINE>
<LINE>And to the manner born, it is a custom</LINE>
<LINE>More honor&#8217;d in the breach than the observance.</LINE>
<LINE>This heavy-headed revel east and west</LINE>
<LINE>Makes us traduc&#8217;d and tax&#8217;d of other nations.</LINE>
<LINE>They clip us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</LINE>
<LINE>Soil our addition, and indeed it takes</LINE>
<LINE>From our achievements, though perform&#8217;d at height,</LINE>
<LINE>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</LINE>
<LINE>So, oft it chances in particular men,</LINE>
<LINE>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</LINE>
<LINE>As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty</LINE>
<LINE>(Since nature cannot choose his origin),</LINE>
<LINE>By their o&#8217;ergrowth of some complexion</LINE>
<LINE>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by some habit, that too much o&#8217;er-leavens</LINE>
<LINE>The form of plausive manners&#8212;that these men,</LINE>
<LINE>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</LINE>
<LINE>Being nature&#8217;s livery, or fortune&#8217;s star,</LINE>
<LINE>His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,</LINE>
<LINE>As infinite as man may undergo,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall in the general censure take corruption</LINE>
<LINE>From that particular fault: the dram of ev&#8217;l</LINE>
<LINE>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</LINE>
<LINE>To his own scandal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ghost.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Look, my lord, it comes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Be thy intents wicked, or charitable,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou com&#8217;st in such a questionable shape</LINE>
<LINE>That I will speak to thee. I&#8217;ll call thee Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me!</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell</LINE>
<LINE>Why thy canoniz&#8217;d bones, hearsed in death,</LINE>
<LINE>Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath op&#8217;d his ponderous and marble jaws</LINE>
<LINE>To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel</LINE>
<LINE>Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Making night hideous, and we fools of nature</LINE>
<LINE>So horridly to shake our disposition</LINE>
<LINE>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?</LINE>
<LINE>Say why is this? wherefore? what should we do?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Ghost beckons Hamlet.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It beckons you to go away with it,</LINE>
<LINE>As if it some impartment did desire</LINE>
<LINE>To you alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Look with what courteous action</LINE>
<LINE>It waves you to a more removed ground,</LINE>
<LINE>But do not go with it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">No, by no means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It will not speak, then I will follow it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why, what should be the fear?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not set my life at a pin&#8217;s fee,</LINE>
<LINE>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a thing immortal as itself?</LINE>
<LINE>It waves me forth again, I&#8217;ll follow it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</LINE>
<LINE>That beetles o&#8217;er his base into the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And there assume some other horrible form</LINE>
<LINE>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,</LINE>
<LINE>And draw you into madness? Think of it.</LINE>
<LINE>The very place puts toys of desperation,</LINE>
<LINE>Without more motive, into every brain</LINE>
<LINE>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</LINE>
<LINE>And hears it roar beneath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">It waves me still.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Go on, I&#8217;ll follow thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall not go, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hold off your hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be rul&#8217;d, you shall not go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My fate cries out,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes each petty artere in this body</LINE>
<LINE>As hardy as the Nemean lion&#8217;s nerve.</LINE>
<LINE>Still am I call&#8217;d. Unhand me, gentlemen.</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I&#8217;ll make a ghost of him that lets me!</LINE>
<LINE>I say away!&#8212;Go on, I&#8217;ll follow thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I&#8217;ll go no further.</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Alas, poor ghost!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</LINE>
<LINE>To what I shall unfold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Speak, I am bound to hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am thy father&#8217;s spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Doom&#8217;d for a certain term to walk the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And for the day confin&#8217;d to fast in fires,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Are burnt and purg&#8217;d away. But that I am forbid</LINE>
<LINE>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</LINE>
<LINE>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</LINE>
<LINE>Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy knotted and combined locks to part,</LINE>
<LINE>And each particular hair to stand an end,</LINE>
<LINE>Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.</LINE>
<LINE>But this eternal blazon must not be</LINE>
<LINE>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou didst ever thy dear father love&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Murder!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Murder most foul, as in the best it is,</LINE>
<LINE>But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Haste me to know&#8217;t, that I with wings as swift</LINE>
<LINE>As meditation, or the thoughts of love,</LINE>
<LINE>May sweep to my revenge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I find thee apt,</LINE>
<LINE>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed</LINE>
<LINE>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>A serpent stung me, so the whole ear of Denmark</LINE>
<LINE>Is by a forged process of my death</LINE>
<LINE>Rankly abus&#8217;d; but know, thou noble youth,</LINE>
<LINE>The serpent that did sting thy father&#8217;s life</LINE>
<LINE>Now wears his crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O my prophetic soul!</LINE>
<LINE>My uncle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</LINE>
<LINE>With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O wicked wit and gifts that have the power</LINE>
<LINE>So to seduce!&#8212;won to his shameful lust</LINE>
<LINE>The will of my most seeming virtuous queen.</LINE>
<LINE>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there</LINE>
<LINE>From me, whose love was of that dignity</LINE>
<LINE>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</LINE>
<LINE>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</LINE>
<LINE>To those of mine!</LINE>
<LINE>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</LINE>
<LINE>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>So lust, though to a radiant angel link&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Will sate itself in a celestial bed</LINE>
<LINE>And prey on garbage.</LINE>
<LINE>But soft, methinks I scent the morning air,</LINE>
<LINE>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>My custom always of the afternoon,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</LINE>
<LINE>With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the porches of my ears did pour</LINE>
<LINE>The leprous distillment, whose effect</LINE>
<LINE>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</LINE>
<LINE>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</LINE>
<LINE>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a sudden vigor it doth posset</LINE>
<LINE>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</LINE>
<LINE>The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And a most instant tetter bark&#8217;d about,</LINE>
<LINE>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust</LINE>
<LINE>All my smooth body.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother&#8217;s hand</LINE>
<LINE>Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</LINE>
<LINE>Unhous&#8217;led, disappointed, unanel&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>No reck&#8217;ning made, but sent to my account</LINE>
<LINE>With all my imperfections on my head.</LINE>
<LINE>O, horrible, O, horrible, most horrible!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not,</LINE>
<LINE>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</LINE>
<LINE>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</LINE>
<LINE>But howsomever thou pursues this act,</LINE>
<LINE>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</LINE>
<LINE>Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge</LINE>
<LINE>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!</LINE>
<LINE>The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</LINE>
<LINE>And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall I couple hell? O fie, hold, hold, my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my sinows, grow not instant old,</LINE>
<LINE>But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat</LINE>
<LINE>In this distracted globe. Remember thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, from the table of my memory</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll wipe away all trivial fond records,</LINE>
<LINE>All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past</LINE>
<LINE>That youth and observation copied there,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy commandement all alone shall live</LINE>
<LINE>Within the book and volume of my brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Unmix&#8217;d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>O most pernicious woman!</LINE>
<LINE>O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!</LINE>
<LINE>My tables&#8212;meet it is I set it down</LINE>
<LINE>That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!</LINE>
<LINE>At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>He writes.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Polonius, Reynaldo, Ophelia)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter old Polonius with his man, Reynaldo.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall do marvell&#8217;s wisely, good Reynaldo,</LINE>
<LINE>Before you visit him, to make inquire</LINE>
<LINE>Of his behavior.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">My lord, I did intend it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,</LINE>
<LINE>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</LINE>
<LINE>What company, at what expense; and finding</LINE>
<LINE>By this encompassment and drift of question</LINE>
<LINE>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</LINE>
<LINE>Than your particular demands will touch it.</LINE>
<LINE>Take you as &#8217;twere some distant knowledge of him,</LINE>
<LINE>As thus, &#8220;I know his father and his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And in part him.&#8221; Do you mark this, Reynaldo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, very well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;And in part him&#8212;but,&#8221; you may say, &#8220;not well.</LINE>
<LINE>But if&#8217;t be he I mean, he&#8217;s very wild,</LINE>
<LINE>Addicted so and so,&#8221; and there put on him</LINE>
<LINE>What forgeries you please: marry, none so rank</LINE>
<LINE>As may dishonor him, take heed of that,</LINE>
<LINE>But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips</LINE>
<LINE>As are companions noted and most known</LINE>
<LINE>To youth and liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">As gaming, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</LINE>
<LINE>Drabbing&#8212;you may go so far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, that would dishonor him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, as you may season it in the charge:</LINE>
<LINE>You must not put another scandal on him,</LINE>
<LINE>That he is open to incontinency&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly</LINE>
<LINE>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</LINE>
<LINE>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</LINE>
<LINE>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Of general assault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">But, my good lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore should you do this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ay, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I would know that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Marry, sir, here&#8217;s my drift,</LINE>
<LINE>And I believe it is a fetch of wit:</LINE>
<LINE>You laying these slight sallies on my son,</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;twere a thing a little soil&#8217;d wi&#8217; th&#8217; working,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</LINE>
<LINE>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</LINE>
<LINE>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>He closes with you in this consequence:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Good sir,&#8221; or so, or &#8220;friend,&#8221; or &#8220;gentleman,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>According to the phrase or the addition</LINE>
<LINE>Of man and country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Very good, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then, sir, does &#8217;a this&#8212;&#8217;a does&#8212;what was I </LINE>
<LINE>About to say?</LINE>
<LINE>By the mass, I was about to say something.</LINE>
<LINE>Where did I leave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At &#8220;closes in the consequence.&#8220;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">At &#8220;closes in the consequence,&#8221; ay, marry.</LINE>
<LINE>He closes thus: &#8220;I know the gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him yesterday, or th&#8217; other day,</LINE>
<LINE>Or then, or then, with such or such, and as you say,</LINE>
<LINE>There was &#8217;a gaming, there o&#8217;ertook in &#8217;s rouse,</LINE>
<LINE>There falling out at tennis&#8221;; or, perchance,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;I saw him enter such a house of sale,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now,</LINE>
<LINE>Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</LINE>
<LINE>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</LINE>
<LINE>By indirections find directions out;</LINE>
<LINE>So by my former lecture and advice</LINE>
<LINE>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">God buy ye, fare ye well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Observe his inclination in yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And let him ply his music.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Reynaldo.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ophelia.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>How now, Ophelia, what&#8217;s the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With what, i&#8217; th&#8217; name of God?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>No hat upon his head, his stockins fouled,</LINE>
<LINE>Ungart&#8217;red, and down-gyved to his ankle,</LINE>
<LINE>Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a look so piteous in purport</LINE>
<LINE>As if he had been loosed out of hell</LINE>
<LINE>To speak of horrors&#8212;he comes before me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mad for thy love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">My lord, I do not know,</LINE>
<LINE>But truly I do fear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What said he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He took me by the wrist, and held me hard,</LINE>
<LINE>Then goes he to the length of all his arm,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his other hand thus o&#8217;er his brow,</LINE>
<LINE>He falls to such perusal of my face</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;a would draw it. Long stay&#8217;d he so.</LINE>
<LINE>At last, a little shaking of mine arm,</LINE>
<LINE>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>He rais&#8217;d a sigh so piteous and profound</LINE>
<LINE>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</LINE>
<LINE>And end his being. That done, he lets me go,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his head over his shoulder turn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>He seem&#8217;d to find his way without his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>For out a&#8217; doors he went without their helps,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the last bended their light on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the very ecstasy of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose violent property fordoes itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</LINE>
<LINE>As oft as any passions under heaven</LINE>
<LINE>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord, but as you did command</LINE>
<LINE>I did repel his letters, and denied</LINE>
<LINE>His access to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">That hath made him mad.</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</LINE>
<LINE>I had not coted him. I fear&#8217;d he did but trifle</LINE>
<LINE>And meant to wrack thee, but beshrow my jealousy!</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</LINE>
<LINE>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,</LINE>
<LINE>As it is common for the younger sort</LINE>
<LINE>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.</LINE>
<LINE>This must be known, which, being kept close, might move</LINE>
<LINE>More grief to hide, than hate to utter love.</LINE>
<LINE>Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cum aliis.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</LINE>
<LINE>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</LINE>
<LINE>The need we have to use you did provoke</LINE>
<LINE>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</LINE>
<LINE>Of Hamlet&#8217;s transformation; so call it,</LINE>
<LINE>Sith nor th&#8217; exterior nor the inward man</LINE>
<LINE>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</LINE>
<LINE>More than his father&#8217;s death, that thus hath put him</LINE>
<LINE>So much from th&#8217; understanding of himself,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot dream of. I entreat you both</LINE>
<LINE>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,</LINE>
<LINE>That you voutsafe your rest here in our court</LINE>
<LINE>Some little time, so by your companies</LINE>
<LINE>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather</LINE>
<LINE>So much as from occasion you may glean,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus,</LINE>
<LINE>That, open&#8217;d, lies within our remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk&#8217;d of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And sure I am two men there is not living</LINE>
<LINE>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</LINE>
<LINE>To show us so much gentry and good will</LINE>
<LINE>As to expend your time with us a while</LINE>
<LINE>For the supply and profit of our hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</LINE>
<LINE>As fits a king&#8217;s remembrance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Both your Majesties</LINE>
<LINE>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</LINE>
<LINE>Put your dread pleasures more into command</LINE>
<LINE>Than to entreaty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">But we both obey,</LINE>
<LINE>And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,</LINE>
<LINE>To lay our service freely at your feet,</LINE>
<LINE>To be commanded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech you instantly to visit</LINE>
<LINE>My too much changed son. Go some of you</LINE>
<LINE>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heavens make our presence and our practices</LINE>
<LINE>Pleasant and helpful to him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ay, amen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern with some Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Th&#8217; embassadors from Norway, my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Are joyfully return&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou still hast been the father of good news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege</LINE>
<LINE>I hold my duty as I hold my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Both to my God and to my gracious king;</LINE>
<LINE>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</LINE>
<LINE>As it hath us&#8217;d to do, that I have found</LINE>
<LINE>The very cause of Hamlet&#8217;s lunacy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, speak of that, that do I long to hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give first admittance to th&#8217; embassadors;</LINE>
<LINE>My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</LINE>
<LINE>The head and source of all your son&#8217;s distemper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it is no other but the main,</LINE>
<LINE>His father&#8217;s death and our o&#8217;erhasty marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius, the Ambassadors.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we shall sift him.&#8212;Welcome, my good friends!</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</LINE>
<LINE>His nephew&#8217;s levies, which to him appear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To be a preparation &#8217;gainst the Polack;</LINE>
<LINE>But better look&#8217;d into, he truly found</LINE>
<LINE>It was against your Highness. Whereat griev&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That so his sickness, age, and impotence</LINE>
<LINE>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</LINE>
<LINE>On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,</LINE>
<LINE>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes vow before his uncle never more</LINE>
<LINE>To give th&#8217; assay of arms against your Majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Gives him threescore thousand crowns in annual fee,</LINE>
<LINE>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>So levied, as before, against the Polack,</LINE>
<LINE>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Giving a paper.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>That it might please you to give quiet pass</LINE>
<LINE>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>On such regards of safety and allowance</LINE>
<LINE>As therein are set down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">It likes us well,</LINE>
<LINE>And at our more considered time we&#8217;ll read,</LINE>
<LINE>Answer, and think upon this business.</LINE>
<LINE>Mean time, we thank you for your well-took labor.</LINE>
<LINE>Go to your rest, at night we&#8217;ll feast together.</LINE>
<LINE>Most welcome home!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Ambassadors and Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">This business is well ended.</LINE>
<LINE>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</LINE>
<LINE>What majesty should be, what duty is,</LINE>
<LINE>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</LINE>
<LINE>Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</LINE>
<LINE>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be brief. Your noble son is mad:</LINE>
<LINE>Mad call I it, for to define true madness,</LINE>
<LINE>What is&#8217;t but to be nothing else but mad?</LINE>
<LINE>But let that go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More matter with less art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</LINE>
<LINE>That he&#8217;s mad, &#8217;tis true, &#8217;tis true &#8217;tis pity,</LINE>
<LINE>And pity &#8217;tis &#8217;tis true&#8212;a foolish figure,</LINE>
<LINE>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</LINE>
<LINE>Mad let us grant him then, and now remains</LINE>
<LINE>That we find out the cause of this effect,</LINE>
<LINE>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</LINE>
<LINE>For this effect defective comes by cause:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.</LINE>
<LINE>Perpend.</LINE>
<LINE>I have a daughter&#8212;have while she is mine&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Who in her duty and obedience, mark,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads the salutation of the letter.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>&#8220;To the celestial and my soul&#8217;s idol, the most beautified Ophelia&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s an ill phrase, a vile phrase, &#8220;beautified&#8221; is a vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;In her excellent white bosom, these, etc.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Came this from Hamlet to her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads the letter.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="2">&#8220;Doubt thou the stars are fire,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Doubt that the sun doth move,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Doubt truth to be a liar,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">But never doubt I love.</LINE>
<LINE>O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</LINE>
<LINE>Thine evermore, most dear lady,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>This in obedience hath my daughter shown me,</LINE>
<LINE>And more above, hath his solicitings,</LINE>
<LINE>As they fell out by time, by means, and place,</LINE>
<LINE>All given to mine ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">But how hath she</LINE>
<LINE>Receiv&#8217;d his love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What do you think of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As of a man faithful and honorable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</LINE>
<LINE>When I had seen this hot love on the wing&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>As I perceiv&#8217;d it (I must tell you that)</LINE>
<LINE>Before my daughter told me&#8212;what might you,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,</LINE>
<LINE>If I had play&#8217;d the desk or table-book,</LINE>
<LINE>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</LINE>
<LINE>Or look&#8217;d upon this love with idle sight,</LINE>
<LINE>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</LINE>
<LINE>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star;</LINE>
<LINE>This must not be&#8221;; and then I prescripts gave her,</LINE>
<LINE>That she should lock herself from his resort,</LINE>
<LINE>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</LINE>
<LINE>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;</LINE>
<LINE>And he repell&#8217;d, a short tale to make,</LINE>
<LINE>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</LINE>
<LINE>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</LINE>
<LINE>Thence to a lightness, and by this declension,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the madness wherein now he raves,</LINE>
<LINE>And all we mourn for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Do you think &#8217;tis this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be, very like.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath there been such a time&#8212;I would fain know that&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That I have positively said, &#8220;&#8217;Tis so,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>When it prov&#8217;d otherwise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Not that I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Points to his head and shoulder.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Take this from this, if this be otherwise.</LINE>
<LINE>If circumstances lead me, I will find</LINE>
<LINE>Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Within the centre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">How may we try it further?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know sometimes he walks four hours together</LINE>
<LINE>Here in the lobby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">So he does indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At such a time I&#8217;ll loose my daughter to him.</LINE>
<LINE>Be you and I behind an arras then,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark the encounter: if he love her not,</LINE>
<LINE>And be not from his reason fall&#8217;n thereon,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be no assistant for a state,</LINE>
<LINE>But keep a farm and carters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">We will try it.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hamlet reading on a book.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Away, I do beseech you, both away.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll board him presently.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt King and Queen.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="5">O, give me leave,</LINE>
<LINE>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God-a-mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you know me, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent well, you are a fishmonger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I would you were so honest a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honest, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man pick&#8217;d out of ten thousand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s very true, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion&#8212;Have you a daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let her not walk i&#8217; th&#8217; sun. Conception is a blessing, but as your daughter may conceive, friend, look to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR><LINE>How say you by that? still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first, &#8217;a said I was a fishmonger. &#8217;A is far gone. And truly in my youth I suff&#8217;red much extremity for love&#8212;very near this. I&#8217;ll speak to him again.&#8212;What do you read, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Words, words, words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the matter, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Between who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR> <LINE>Though this be madness, yet there is method in&#8217;t.&#8212;Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Into my grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER> 
<LINE>Indeed that&#8217;s out of the air.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be deliver&#8217;d of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.&#8212;My lord, I will take my leave of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You cannot take from me any thing that I will not more willingly part withal&#8212;except my life, except my life, except my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You go to seek the Lord Hamlet, there he is.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>To Polonius.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>God save you, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honor&#8217;d lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My most dear lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do you both?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the indifferent children of the earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happy, in that we are not over-happy, on Fortune&#8217;s cap we are not the very button.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor the soles of her shoe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, her privates we.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true, she is a strumpet. What news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None, my lord, but the world&#8217;s grown honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserv&#8217;d at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prison, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Denmark&#8217;s a prison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is the world one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o&#8217; th&#8217; worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We think not so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then &#8217;tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then your ambition makes it one. &#8217;Tis too narrow for your mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space&#8212;were it not that I have bad dreams.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dream itself is but a shadow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow&#8217;s shadow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch&#8217;d heroes the beggars&#8217; shadows. Shall we to th&#8217; court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</LINE>
 </SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH ROS., GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll wait upon you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks&#8212;but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? is it your own inclining? is it a free visitation? Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come&#8212;nay, speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should we say, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Any thing but to th&#8217; purpose. You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to color. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what end, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserv&#8217;d love, and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside to Guildenstern.</STAGEDIR><LINE>What say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR><LINE>Nay then I have an eye of you!&#8212;If you love me, hold not off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, we were sent for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you why, so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late&#8212;but wherefore I know not&#8212;lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o&#8217;erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable in action, how like an angel in apprehension, how like a god! the beauty of the world; the paragon of animals; and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me&#8212;nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did ye laugh then, when I said, &#8220;Man delights not me&#8221;?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that plays the king shall be welcome&#8212;his Majesty shall have tribute on me, the adventerous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a&#8217; th&#8217; sere, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for&#8217;t. What players are they?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so follow&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No indeed are they not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How comes it? do they grow rusty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapp&#8217;d for&#8217;t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages&#8212;so they call them&#8212;that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are they children? Who maintains &#8217;em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, there has been much to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do the boys carry it away?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that they do, my lord&#8212;Hercules and his load too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not very strange, for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father liv&#8217;d, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. &#8217;Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A flourish for the Players.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There are the players.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then: th&#8217; appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome; but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceiv&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what, my dear lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hand-saw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well be with you, gentlemen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Aside to them.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too&#8212;at each ear a hearer&#8212;that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happily he is the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will prophesy, he comes to tell me of the players, mark it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aloud.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You say right, sir, a&#8217; Monday morning, &#8217;twas then indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have news to tell you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The actors are come hither, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Buzz, buzz!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon my honor&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Then came each actor on his ass&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER> 
<LINE>The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral scene individable, or poem unlimited; Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of writ and the liberty: these are the only men.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a treasure had he, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;One fair daughter, and no more,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">The which he loved passing well.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR> <LINE>Still on my daughter.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not i&#8217; th&#8217; right, old Jephthah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that follows not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What follows then, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;As by lot, God wot,&#8220;</LINE>
<LINE>And then, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;It came to pass, as most like it was&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>The first row of the pious chanson will show you more, for look where my abridgment comes.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Players, four or five.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, old friend! why, thy face is valanc&#8217;d since I saw thee last; com&#8217;st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! by&#8217; lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not crack&#8217;d within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We&#8217;ll e&#8217;en to&#8217;t like French falc&#8217;ners&#8212;fly at any thing we see; we&#8217;ll have a speech straight. Come give us a taste of your quality, come, a passionate speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. PLAY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What speech, my good lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER> 
<LINE>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas&#8217;d not the million, &#8217;twas caviary to the general, but it was&#8212;as I receiv&#8217;d it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine&#8212;an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but call&#8217;d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in&#8217;t I chiefly lov&#8217;d, &#8217;twas Aeneas&#8217; tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam&#8217;s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line&#8212;let me see, let me see:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, like th&#8217; Hyrcanian beast&#8212;&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</LINE>
<LINE>When he lay couched in th&#8217; ominous horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With heraldy more dismal: head to foot</LINE>
<LINE>Now is he total gules, horridly trick&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Bak&#8217;d and impasted with the parching streets,</LINE>
<LINE>That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</LINE>
<LINE>To their lord&#8217;s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus o&#8217;er-sized with coagulate gore,</LINE>
<LINE>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</LINE>
<LINE>Old grandsire Priam seeks.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>So proceed you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. PLAY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Anon he finds him</LINE>
<LINE>Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</LINE>
<LINE>Repugnant to command. Unequal match&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,</LINE>
<LINE>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</LINE>
<LINE>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</LINE>
<LINE>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#8217; ear; for lo his sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was declining on the milky head</LINE>
<LINE>Of reverent Priam, seem&#8217;d i&#8217; th&#8217; air to stick.</LINE>
<LINE>So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a neutral to his will and matter,</LINE>
<LINE>Did nothing.</LINE>
<LINE>But as we often see, against some storm,</LINE>
<LINE>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</LINE>
<LINE>The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</LINE>
<LINE>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</LINE>
<LINE>Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus&#8217; pause,</LINE>
<LINE>A roused vengeance sets him new a-work,</LINE>
<LINE>And never did the Cyclops&#8217; hammers fall</LINE>
<LINE>On Mars&#8217;s armor forg&#8217;d for proof eterne</LINE>
<LINE>With less remorse than Pyrrhus&#8217; bleeding sword</LINE>
<LINE>Now falls on Priam.</LINE>
<LINE>Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,</LINE>
<LINE>In general synod take away her power!</LINE>
<LINE>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</LINE>
<LINE>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>As low as to the fiends!&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">Now I am alone.</LINE>
<LINE>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</LINE>
<LINE>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</LINE>
<LINE>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</LINE>
<LINE>That from her working all the visage wann&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>A broken voice, an&#8217; his whole function suiting</LINE>
<LINE>With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>For Hecuba!</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should weep for her? What would he do</LINE>
<LINE>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</LINE>
<LINE>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</LINE>
<LINE>Make mad the guilty, and appall the free,</LINE>
<LINE>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</LINE>
<LINE>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</LINE>
<LINE>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak</LINE>
<LINE>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</LINE>
<LINE>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose property and most dear life</LINE>
<LINE>A damn&#8217;d defeat was made. Am I a coward?</LINE>
<LINE>Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across,</LINE>
<LINE>Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i&#8217; th&#8217; throat</LINE>
<LINE>As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?</LINE>
<LINE>Hah, &#8217;swounds, I should take it; for it cannot be</LINE>

<LINE>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, the son of a dear father murdered,</LINE>
<LINE>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Must like a whore unpack my heart with words,</LINE>

<LINE>Been strook so to the soul, that presently</LINE>
<LINE>They have proclaim&#8217;d their malefactions:</LINE>
<LINE>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</LINE>
<LINE>With most miraculous organ. I&#8217;ll have these players</LINE>
<LINE>Play something like the murder of my father</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll tent him to the quick. If &#8217;a do blench,</LINE>

<LINE>May be a dev&#8217;l, and the dev&#8217;l hath power</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>As he is very potent with such spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Abuses me to damn me. I&#8217;ll have grounds</LINE>
<LINE>More relative than this&#8212;the play&#8217;s the thing</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</LINE>
<LINE>Whether &#8217;tis nobler in the mind to suffer</LINE>
<LINE>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</LINE>
<LINE>And by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>No more, and by a sleep to say we end</LINE>
<LINE>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</LINE>
<LINE>That flesh is heir to; &#8217;tis a consummation</LINE>
<LINE>Devoutly to be wish&#8217;d. To die, to sleep&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>To sleep, perchance to dream&#8212;ay, there&#8217;s the rub,</LINE>
<LINE>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</LINE>
<LINE>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</LINE>
<LINE>Must give us pause; there&#8217;s the respect</LINE>
<LINE>That makes calamity of so long life:</LINE>
<LINE>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; oppressor&#8217;s wrong, the proud man&#8217;s contumely,</LINE>
<LINE>The pangs of despis&#8217;d love, the law&#8217;s delay,</LINE>
<LINE>The insolence of office, and the spurns</LINE>
<LINE>That patient merit of th&#8217; unworthy takes,</LINE>
<LINE>When he himself might his quietus make</LINE>
<LINE>With a bare bodkin; who would fardels bear,</LINE>
<LINE>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the dread of something after death,</LINE>
<LINE>The undiscover&#8217;d country, from whose bourn</LINE>
<LINE>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes us rather bear those ills we have,</LINE>
<LINE>Than fly to others that we know not of?</LINE>
<LINE>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus the native hue of resolution</LINE>
<LINE>Is sicklied o&#8217;er with the pale cast of thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</LINE>
<LINE>With this regard their currents turn awry,</LINE>
<LINE>And lose the name of action.&#8212;Soft you now,</LINE>
<LINE>The fair Ophelia. Nymph, in thy orisons</LINE>

<LINE>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</LINE>

I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunn&#8217;ry. Where&#8217;s your father?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc&#8217;d it to you,
trippingly on the tongue, but if you mouth it, as many of our players
do, I had as live the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very
torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you
must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the
groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipt for
 o&#8217;erdoing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod, pray you avoid it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. PLAY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant your honor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this
special observance, that you o&#8217;erstep not the modesty of nature: for
any thing so o&#8217;erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both
at the first and now, was and is, to hold as &#8217;twere the mirror up
to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the
very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but
make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your
allowance o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I have seen play&#8212;and heard others praise, and that highly&#8212;not to
speak it profanely, that, neither having th&#8217; accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow&#8217;d
that I have thought some of Nature&#8217;s journeymen had made men, and not
made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. </LINE>

<LINE>I hope we have reform&#8217;d that indifferently with us, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak
no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will
themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be
then to be consider&#8217;d. That&#8217;s villainous, and shows a most pitiful
ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Players.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And the Queen too, and that presently.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What ho, Horatio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Horatio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, sweet lord, at your service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Horatio, thou art e&#8217;en as just a man</LINE>
<LINE>As e&#8217;er my conversation cop&#8217;d withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my dear lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Nay, do not think I flatter,</LINE>
<LINE>For what advancement may I hope from thee</LINE>
<LINE>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits</LINE>
<LINE>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,</LINE>
<LINE>And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee</LINE>
<LINE>Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?</LINE>
<LINE>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</LINE>
<LINE>And could of men distinguish her election,</LINE>
<LINE>Sh&#8217; hath seal&#8217;d thee for herself, for thou hast been</LINE>
<LINE>As one in suff&#8217;ring all that suffers nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>A man that Fortune&#8217;s buffets and rewards</LINE>
<LINE>Hast ta&#8217;en with equal thanks; and blest are those</LINE>
<LINE>Whose blood and judgment are so well co-meddled,</LINE>
<LINE>That they are not a pipe for Fortune&#8217;s finger</LINE>
<LINE>To sound what stop she please. Give me that man</LINE>
<LINE>That is not passion&#8217;s slave, and I will wear him</LINE>
<LINE>In my heart&#8217;s core, ay, in my heart of heart,</LINE>
<LINE>As I do thee. Something too much of this.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a play tonight before the King,</LINE>
<LINE>One scene of it comes near the circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have told thee of my father&#8217;s death.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the very comment of thy soul</LINE>
<LINE>Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt</LINE>
<LINE>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</LINE>
<LINE>And my imaginations are as foul</LINE>
<LINE>As Vulcan&#8217;s stithy. Give him heedful note,</LINE>
<LINE>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</LINE>
<LINE>And after we will both our judgments join</LINE>
<LINE>In censure of his seeming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Well, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>If &#8217;a steal aught the whilst this play is playing,</LINE>

<LINE>How fares our cousin Hamlet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent, i&#8217; faith, of the chameleon&#8217;s dish: I eat the air, promise-cramm&#8217;d&#8212;you cannot feed capons so.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What did you enact?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill&#8217;d i&#8217; th&#8217; Capitol; Brutus kill&#8217;d me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry, for look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within &#8217;s two hours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, &#8217;tis twice two months, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So long? Nay then let the dev&#8217;l wear black, for I&#8217;ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there&#8217;s hope a great man&#8217;s memory may outlive his life half a year, but, by&#8217;r lady, &#8217;a must build churches then, or else shall &#8217;a suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is, &#8220;For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot.&#8220;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The trumpets sounds. Dumb show follows.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly, the Queen embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon come in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper&#8217;s ears, and leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, makes passionate action. The pois&#8217;ner with some three or four mutes
come in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The pois&#8217;ner woos the Queen with gifts; she seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts love.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>What means this, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Marry, this&#8217; miching mallecho, it means mischief.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prologue.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel, they&#8217;ll tell all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will &#8217;a tell us what this show meant?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be not you asham&#8217;d to show, he&#8217;ll not shame to tell you what it means.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are naught, you are naught. I&#8217;ll mark the play.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For us, and for our tragedy,</LINE>
<LINE>Here stooping to your clemency,</LINE>
<LINE>We beg your hearing patiently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis brief, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As woman&#8217;s love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Players, King and Queen.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Full thirty times hath Phoebus&#8217; cart gone round</LINE>
<LINE>Neptune&#8217;s salt wash and Tellus&#8217; orbed ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen</LINE>
<LINE>About the world have times twelve thirties been,</LINE>
<LINE>Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands</LINE>
<LINE>Unite comutual in most sacred bands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So many journeys may the sun and moon</LINE>
<LINE>Make us again count o&#8217;er ere love be done!</LINE>
<LINE>But woe is me, you are so sick of late,</LINE>
<LINE>So far from cheer and from your former state,</LINE>
<LINE>That I distrust you. Yet though I distrust,</LINE>
<LINE>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must,</LINE>
<LINE>For women&#8217;s fear and love hold quantity,</LINE>
<LINE>In neither aught, or in extremity.</LINE>
<LINE>Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,</LINE>
<LINE>And as my love is siz&#8217;d, my fear is so.</LINE>
<LINE>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;</LINE>
<LINE>Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;</LINE>
<LINE>My operant powers their functions leave to do,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,</LINE>
<LINE>Honor&#8217;d, belov&#8217;d, and haply one as kind</LINE>
<LINE>For husband shalt thou&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, confound the rest!</LINE>
<LINE>Such love must needs be treason in my breast.</LINE>
<LINE>In second husband let me be accurs&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>None wed the second but who kill&#8217;d the first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That&#8217;s wormwood!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The instances that second marriage move</LINE>
<LINE>Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.</LINE>
<LINE>A second time I kill my husband dead,</LINE>
<LINE>When second husband kisses me in bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do believe you think what now you speak,</LINE>
<LINE>But what we do determine, oft we break.</LINE>
<LINE>Purpose is but the slave to memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Of violent birth, but poor validity,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,</LINE>
<LINE>But fall unshaken when they mellow be.</LINE>
<LINE>Most necessary &#8217;tis that we forget</LINE>
<LINE>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.</LINE>
<LINE>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</LINE>
<LINE>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</LINE>
<LINE>The violence of either grief or joy</LINE>
<LINE>Their own enactures with themselves destroy.</LINE>
<LINE>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;</LINE>
<LINE>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</LINE>
<LINE>This world is not for aye, nor &#8217;tis not strange</LINE>
<LINE>That even our loves should with our fortunes change:</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis a question left us yet to prove,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</LINE>
<LINE>The great man down, you mark his favorite flies,</LINE>
<LINE>The poor advanc&#8217;d makes friends of enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,</LINE>
<LINE>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And who in want a hollow friend doth try,</LINE>
<LINE>Directly seasons him his enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>But orderly to end where I begun,</LINE>
<LINE>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</LINE>
<LINE>That our devices still are overthrown,</LINE>
<LINE>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:</LINE>
<LINE>So think thou wilt no second husband wed,</LINE>
<LINE>But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,</LINE>
<LINE>Sport and repose lock from me day and night,</LINE>
<LINE>To desperation turn my trust and hope,</LINE>
<LINE>An anchor&#8217;s cheer in prison be my scope!</LINE>
<LINE>Each opposite that blanks the face of joy</LINE>
<LINE>Meet what I would have well and it destroy!</LINE>
<LINE>Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,</LINE>
<LINE>If once I be a widow, ever I be a wife!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If she should break it now!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here a while,</LINE>
<LINE>My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile</LINE>
<LINE>The tedious day with sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sleeps.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sleep rock thy brain,</LINE>
<LINE>And never come mischance between us twain!</LINE>

<LINE>Madam, how like you this play?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O but she&#8217;ll keep her word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you heard the argument? is there no offense in&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>What do you call the play?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;The Mouse-trap.&#8221; Marry, how? tropically: this play is the image of a murder done in Vienna; Gonzago is the duke&#8217;s name, his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. &#8217;Tis a knavish piece of work, but what of that? Your Majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the gall&#8217;d jade winch, our withers are unwrung.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lucianus.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Pours the poison in his ears.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;A poisons him i&#8217; th&#8217; garden for his estate. His name&#8217;s Gonzago, the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago&#8217;s wife.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord, with choler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor, for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.</LINE>

<LINE>Make you a wholesome answer&#8212;my wit&#8217;s diseas&#8217;d. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command, or rather, as you say, my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely bar
the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I lack advancement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, but &#8220;While the grass grows&#8221;&#8212;the proverb is something musty.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Players with recorders.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>O, the recorders! Let me see one.&#8212;To withdraw with you&#8212;why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know no touch of it, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But these cannot I command to any utt&#8217;rance of harmony. I have not the skill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me, you would seem to know my stops, you would pluck out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. &#8217;Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play&#8217;d on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>God bless you, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>O heart, lose not thy nature! let not ever</LINE>
<LINE>The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be cruel, not unnatural;</LINE>
<LINE>I will speak daggers to her, but use none.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, he&#8217;s going to his mother&#8217;s closet.</LINE>
<LINE>Behind the arras I&#8217;ll convey myself</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the process. I&#8217;ll warrant she&#8217;ll tax him home,</LINE>
<LINE>And as you said, and wisely was it said,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Since nature makes them partial, should o&#8217;erhear</LINE>
<LINE>The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll call upon you ere you go to bed,</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Thanks, dear my lord.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>It hath the primal eldest curse upon&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>A brother&#8217;s murder. Pray can I not,</LINE>
<LINE>Though inclination be as sharp as will.</LINE>
<LINE>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a man to double business bound,</LINE>
<LINE>I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</LINE>
<LINE>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</LINE>
<LINE>Were thicker than itself with brother&#8217;s blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</LINE>
<LINE>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</LINE>
<LINE>But to confront the visage of offense?</LINE>
<LINE>And what&#8217;s in prayer but this twofold force,</LINE>
<LINE>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Or pardon&#8217;d being down? then I&#8217;ll look up.</LINE>
<LINE>My fault is past, but, O, what form of prayer</LINE>
<LINE>Can serve my turn? &#8220;Forgive me my foul murder&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot be, since I am still possess&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of those effects for which I did the murder:</LINE>
<LINE>My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.</LINE>
<LINE>May one be pardon&#8217;d and retain th&#8217; offense?</LINE>
<LINE>In the corrupted currents of this world</LINE>
<LINE>Offense&#8217;s gilded hand may shove by justice,</LINE>
<LINE>And oft &#8217;tis seen the wicked prize itself</LINE>
<LINE>Buys out the law, but &#8217;tis not so above:</LINE>
<LINE>There is no shuffling, there the action lies</LINE>
<LINE>In his true nature, and we ourselves compell&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</LINE>
<LINE>To give in evidence. What then? What rests?</LINE>
<LINE>Try what repentance can. What can it not?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet what can it, when one can not repent?</LINE>
<LINE>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</LINE>
<LINE>O limed soul, that struggling to be free</LINE>
<LINE>Art more engag&#8217;d! Help, angels! Make assay,</LINE>
<LINE>Bow, stubborn knees, and heart, with strings of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!</LINE>

<LINE>And so am I reveng&#8217;d. That would be scann&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>A villain kills my father, and for that</LINE>
<LINE>I, his sole son, do this same villain send</LINE>
<LINE>To heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;A took my father grossly, full of bread,</LINE>
<LINE>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May,</LINE>
<LINE>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?</LINE>
<LINE>But in our circumstance and course of thought</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged,</LINE>
<LINE>To take him in the purging of his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>When he is fit and season&#8217;d for his passage?</LINE>
<LINE>No!</LINE>
<LINE>Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:</LINE>
<LINE>When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in th&#8217; incestious pleasure of his bed,</LINE>
<LINE>At game a-swearing, or about some act</LINE>
<LINE>That has no relish of salvation in&#8217;t&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Such an act</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Ay me, what act,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look here upon this picture, and on this,</LINE>
<LINE>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</LINE>
<LINE>See what a grace was seated on this brow:</LINE>
<LINE>Hyperion&#8217;s curls, the front of Jove himself,</LINE>
<LINE>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,</LINE>
<LINE>A station like the herald Mercury</LINE>
<LINE>New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,</LINE>
<LINE>A combination and a form indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Where every god did seem to set his seal</LINE>
<LINE>To give the world assurance of a man.</LINE>
<LINE>This was your husband. Look you now what follows:</LINE>
<LINE>Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</LINE>
<LINE>And batten on this moor? ha, have you eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot call it love, for at your age</LINE>
<LINE>The heyday in the blood is tame, it&#8217;s humble,</LINE>
<LINE>And waits upon the judgment, and what judgment</LINE>
<LINE>Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,</LINE>
<LINE>Else could you not have motion, but sure that sense</LINE>
<LINE>Is apoplex&#8217;d, for madness would not err,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne&#8217;er so thrall&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>But it reserv&#8217;d some quantity of choice</LINE>
<LINE>To serve in such a difference. What devil was&#8217;t</LINE>
<LINE>That thus hath cozen&#8217;d you at hoodman-blind?</LINE>
<LINE>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</LINE>
<LINE>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</LINE>
<LINE>Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?</LINE>
<LINE>Rebellious hell,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou canst mutine in a matron&#8217;s bones,</LINE>
<LINE>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax</LINE>
<LINE>And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame</LINE>
<LINE>When the compulsive ardure gives the charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Since frost itself as actively doth burn,</LINE>
<LINE>And reason panders will.</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Ecstasy?</LINE>
<LINE>My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes as healthful music. It is not madness</LINE>
<LINE>That I have utt&#8217;red. Bring me to the test,</LINE>
<LINE>And I the matter will reword, which madness</LINE>
<LINE>Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That not your trespass but my madness speaks;</LINE>
<LINE>It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,</LINE>
<LINE>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Repent what&#8217;s past, avoid what is to come,</LINE>
<LINE>And do not spread the compost on the weeds</LINE>
<LINE>To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,</LINE>
<LINE>For in the fatness of these pursy times</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, throw away the worser part of it,</LINE>
<LINE>And live the purer with the other half.</LINE>
<LINE>Good night, but go not to my uncle&#8217;s bed&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</LINE>
<LINE>That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,</LINE>
<LINE>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</LINE>
<LINE>That to the use of actions fair and good</LINE>
<LINE>He likewise gives a frock or livery</LINE>
<LINE>That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,</LINE>
<LINE>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</LINE>
<LINE>To the next abstinence, the next more easy;</LINE>
<LINE>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</LINE>
<LINE>And either lodge the devil or throw him out</LINE>
<LINE>With wondrous potency. Once more good night,</LINE>
<LINE>And when you are desirous to be blest,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Pointing to Polonius.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I do repent; but heaven hath pleas&#8217;d it so</LINE>
<LINE>To punish me with this, and this with me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I must be their scourge and minister.</LINE>
<LINE>I will bestow him, and will answer well</LINE>
<LINE>The death I gave him. So again good night.</LINE>
<LINE>I must be cruel only to be kind.</LINE>
<LINE>This bad begins and worse remains behind.</LINE>
<LINE>One word more, good lady.</LINE>

<LINE>Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:</LINE>
<LINE>Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,</LINE>
<LINE>Or paddling in your neck with his damn&#8217;d fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>Make you to ravel all this matter out,</LINE>
<LINE>That I essentially am not in madness,</LINE>
<LINE>But mad in craft. &#8217;Twere good you let him know,</LINE>
<LINE>For who that&#8217;s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</LINE>
<LINE>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</LINE>
<LINE>Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?</LINE>
<LINE>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</LINE>
<LINE>Unpeg the basket on the house&#8217;s top,</LINE>
<LINE>Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,</LINE>
<LINE>To try conclusions in the basket creep,</LINE>

<LINE>Hoist with his own petar, an&#8217;t shall go hard</LINE>
<LINE>But I will delve one yard below their mines,</LINE>
<LINE>And blow them at the moon. O, &#8217;tis most sweet</LINE>
<LINE>When in one line two crafts directly meet.</LINE>
<LINE>This man shall set me packing;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll lug the guts into the neighbor room.</LINE>
<LINE>Mother, good night indeed. This counsellor</LINE>
<LINE>Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not where he eats, but where &#8217;a is eaten; a certain convocation of politic worms are e&#8217;en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots; your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table&#8212;that&#8217;s the end.</LINE>

<LINE>Sure He that made us with such large discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking before and after, gave us not</LINE>
<LINE>That capability and godlike reason</LINE>
<LINE>To fust in us unus&#8217;d. Now whether it be</LINE>
<LINE>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</LINE>
<LINE>Of thinking too precisely on th&#8217; event&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A thought which quarter&#8217;d hath but one part wisdom</LINE>

<LINE>Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means</LINE>
<LINE>To do&#8217;t. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</LINE>

<LINE>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</LINE>
<LINE>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</LINE>
<LINE>To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</LINE>

<LINE>Is not to stir without great argument,</LINE>
<LINE>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</LINE>
<LINE>When honor&#8217;s at the stake. How stand I then,</LINE>

<LINE>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And let all sleep, while to my shame I see</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She speaks much of her father, says she hears</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s tricks i&#8217; th&#8217; world, and hems, and beats her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt</LINE>
<LINE>That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the unshaped use of it doth move</LINE>
<LINE>The hearers to collection; they yawn at it,</LINE>
<LINE>And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed would make one think there might be thought,</LINE>
<LINE>Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</LINE>

<LINE>When sorrows come, they come not single spies,</LINE>
<LINE>But in battalions: first, her father slain;</LINE>
<LINE>Next, your son gone, and he most violent author</LINE>
<LINE>Of his own just remove; the people muddied,</LINE>
<LINE>Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers</LINE>
<LINE>For good Polonius&#8217; death; and we have done but greenly</LINE>
<LINE>In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia</LINE>
<LINE>Divided from herself and her fair judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts;</LINE>
<LINE>Last, and as much containing as all these,</LINE>
<LINE>Her brother is in secret come from France,</LINE>
<LINE>Feeds on this wonder, keeps himself in clouds,</LINE>

<LINE>Wherein necessity, of matter beggar&#8217;d,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook&#8217;d this, give these fellows some means to the King, they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of ail, we put on a compell&#8217;d valor, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldest fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb, yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England, of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Come, I will give you way for these your letters,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,</LINE>
<LINE>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which hath your noble father slain</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">It well appears. But tell me</LINE>
<LINE>Why you proceeded not against these feats</LINE>
<LINE>So criminal and so capital in nature,</LINE>
<LINE>As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else</LINE>
<LINE>You mainly were stirr&#8217;d up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, for two special reasons,</LINE>
<LINE>Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinow&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet to me th&#8217; are strong. The Queen his mother</LINE>
<LINE>Lives almost by his looks, and for myself&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>My virtue or my plague, be it either which&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>She is so conjunctive to my life and soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</LINE>
<LINE>I could not but by her. The other motive,</LINE>
<LINE>Why to a public count I might not go,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the great love the general gender bear him,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</LINE>
<LINE>Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,</LINE>
<LINE>Too slightly timber&#8217;d for so loud a wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Would have reverted to my bow again,</LINE>
<LINE>But not where I have aim&#8217;d them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so have I a noble father lost,</LINE>
<LINE>A sister driven into desp&#8217;rate terms,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</LINE>
<LINE>Stood challenger on mount of all the age</LINE>
<LINE>For her perfections&#8212;but my revenge will come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think</LINE>
<LINE>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</LINE>
<LINE>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</LINE>
<LINE>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.</LINE>
<LINE>I lov&#8217;d your father, and we love ourself,</LINE>
<LINE>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>&#8220;High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes, when I shall, first asking you pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return. Hamlet.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you the hand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">&#8217;Tis Hamlet&#8217;s character. &#8220;Naked&#8221;!</LINE>
<LINE>And in a postscript here he says &#8220;alone.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Can you devise me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,</LINE>
<LINE>It warms the very sickness in my heart</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Thus didst thou.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">If it be so, Laertes&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>As how should it be so? how otherwise?&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be rul&#8217;d by me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ay, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>So you will not o&#8217;errule me to a peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To thine own peace. If he be now returned</LINE>
<LINE>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</LINE>
<LINE>No more to undertake it, I will work him</LINE>
<LINE>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the which he shall not choose but fall;</LINE>
<LINE>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</LINE>
<LINE>But even his mother shall uncharge the practice,</LINE>
<LINE>And call it accident.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My lord, I will be rul&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>The rather if you could devise it so</LINE>
<LINE>That I might be the organ.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">It falls right.</LINE>
<LINE>You have been talk&#8217;d of since your travel much,</LINE>
<LINE>And that in Hamlet&#8217;s hearing, for a quality</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts</LINE>
<LINE>Did not together pluck such envy from him</LINE>
<LINE>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</LINE>
<LINE>Of the unworthiest siege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What part is that, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very riband in the cap of youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes</LINE>
<LINE>The light and careless livery that it wears</LINE>
<LINE>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Importing health and graveness. Two months since</LINE>
<LINE>Here was a gentleman of Normandy:</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen myself, and serv&#8217;d against, the French,</LINE>
<LINE>And they can well on horseback, but this gallant</LINE>
<LINE>Had witchcraft in&#8217;t, he grew unto his seat,</LINE>
<LINE>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</LINE>
<LINE>As had he been incorps&#8217;d and demi-natur&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With the brave beast. So far he topp&#8217;d my thought,</LINE>
<LINE>That I in forgery of shapes and tricks</LINE>
<LINE>Come short of what he did.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The very same.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know him well. He is the brooch indeed</LINE>
<LINE>And gem of all the nation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He made confession of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And gave you such a masterly report</LINE>
<LINE>For art and exercise in your defense,</LINE>
<LINE>And for your rapier most especial,</LINE>
<LINE>That he cried out &#8217;twould be a sight indeed</LINE>
<LINE>If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation</LINE>
<LINE>He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</LINE>
<LINE>If you oppos&#8217;d them. Sir, this report of his</LINE>
<LINE>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</LINE>
<LINE>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</LINE>
<LINE>Your sudden coming o&#8217;er to play with you.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, out of this&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What out of this, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</LINE>
<LINE>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>A face without a heart?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why ask you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not that I think you did not love your father,</LINE>
<LINE>But that I know love is begun by time,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I see, in passages of proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</LINE>
<LINE>There lives within the very flame of love</LINE>
<LINE>A kind of week or snuff that will abate it,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing is at a like goodness still,</LINE>
<LINE>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</LINE>
<LINE>Dies in his own too much. That we would do,</LINE>
<LINE>We should do when we would; for this &#8220;would&#8221; changes,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath abatements and delays as many</LINE>
<LINE>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents,</LINE>
<LINE>And then this &#8217;should&#8217; is like a spendthrift&#8217;s sigh,</LINE>
<LINE>That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th&#8217; ulcer:</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake</LINE>
<LINE>To show yourself indeed your father&#8217;s son</LINE>
<LINE>More than in words?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">To cut his throat i&#8217; th&#8217; church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No place indeed should murder sanctuarize,</LINE>
<LINE>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet return&#8217;d shall know you are come home.</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll put on those shall praise your excellence,</LINE>
<LINE>And set a double varnish on the fame</LINE>
<LINE>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together,</LINE>
<LINE>And wager o&#8217;er your heads. He, being remiss,</LINE>
<LINE>Most generous, and free from all contriving,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</LINE>
<LINE>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice</LINE>
<LINE>Requite him for your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I will do&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>And for that purpose I&#8217;ll anoint my sword.</LINE>
<LINE>I bought an unction of a mountebank,</LINE>
<LINE>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</LINE>
<LINE>Where it draws blood, no cataplasm so rare,</LINE>
<LINE>Collected from all simples that have virtue</LINE>
<LINE>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</LINE>
<LINE>That is but scratch&#8217;d withal. I&#8217;ll touch my point</LINE>
<LINE>With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,</LINE>
<LINE>It may be death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Let&#8217;s further think of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</LINE>
<LINE>May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,</LINE>
<LINE>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere better not assay&#8217;d; therefore this project</LINE>
<LINE>Should have a back or second, that might hold</LINE>
<LINE>If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I ha&#8217;t!</LINE>
<LINE>When in your motion you are hot and dry&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>As make your bouts more violent to that end&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And that he calls for drink, I&#8217;ll have preferr&#8217;d him</LINE>
<LINE>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a willow grows askaunt the brook,</LINE>
<LINE>That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream,</LINE>
<LINE>Therewith fantastic garlands did she make</LINE>
<LINE>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples</LINE>
<LINE>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</LINE>
<LINE>But our cull-cold maids do dead men&#8217;s fingers call them.</LINE>
<LINE>There on the pendant boughs her crownet weeds</LINE>
<LINE>Clamb&#8217;ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,</LINE>
<LINE>When down her weedy trophies and herself</LINE>
<LINE>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,</LINE>
<LINE>And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Which time she chaunted snatches of old lauds,</LINE>
<LINE>As one incapable of her own distress,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a creature native and indued</LINE>
<LINE>Unto that element. But long it could not be</LINE>
<LINE>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</LINE>
<LINE>Pull&#8217;d the poor wretch from her melodious lay</LINE>

<LINE>I tell thee she is, therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.</LINE>

<LINE>How can that be, unless she drown&#8217;d herself in her own defense?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis found so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be se offendendo, it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three branches&#8212;it is to act, to do, to perform; argal, she drown&#8217;d herself wittingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but hear you, goodman delver&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes, mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, marry, is&#8217;t&#8212;crowner&#8217;s quest law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you ha&#8217; the truth an&#8217;t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out a&#8217; Christian burial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there thou say&#8217;st, and the more pity that great folk should have count&#8217;nance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gard&#8217;ners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam&#8217;s profession.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CLO.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg&#8217;d; could he dig without arms? I&#8217;ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>The gallows-maker, for that outlives a thousand tenants.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well; but how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To&#8217;t again, come.</LINE>

Why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in &#8217;s time a great buyer of land, with his statures, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box, and must th&#8217; inheritor himself have no more, ha?</LINE>

<LINE>How came he mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very strangely, they say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How strangely?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Upon what ground?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long will a man lie i&#8217; th&#8217; earth ere he rot?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, if &#8217;a be not rotten before &#8217;a die&#8212;as we have many pocky corses, that will scarce hold the laying in-&#8217;a will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why he more than another?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, his hide is so tann&#8217;d with his trade that &#8217;a will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here&#8217;s a skull now hath lien you i&#8217; th&#8217; earth three and twenty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose was it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A whoreson mad fellow&#8217;s it was. Whose do you think it was?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! &#8217;a pour&#8217;d a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick&#8217;s skull, the King&#8217;s jester.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This?</LINE>

<LINE>E&#8217;en that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his back a thousand times, and now how abhorr&#8217;d in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss&#8217;d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your own grinning-quite chop-fall&#8217;n. Now get you to my lady&#8217;s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favor she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till &#8217;a find it stopping a bunghole?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, not a jot, but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust, the dust is earth, of earth we make loam, and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?</LINE>
<LINE>Imperious Caesar, dead and turn&#8217;d to clay,</LINE>
<LINE>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.</LINE>
<LINE>O that that earth which kept the world in awe</LINE>
<LINE>Should patch a wall t&#8217; expel the winter&#8217;s flaw!</LINE>
<LINE>But soft, but soft awhile, here comes the king.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter King, Queen, Laertes, and a Doctor of Divinity, following the corse, with Lords attendant.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?</LINE>
<LINE>And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken</LINE>
<LINE>The corse they follow did with desp&#8217;rate hand</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her obsequies have been as far enlarg&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE>She should in ground unsanctified been lodg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I lov&#8217;d Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers</LINE>

<LINE>Millions of acres on us, till our ground,</LINE>

<LINE>So much for this, sir, now shall you see the other&#8212;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember it, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting</LINE>
<LINE>That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay</LINE>
<LINE>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And prais&#8217;d be rashness for it&#8212;let us know</LINE>
<LINE>Our indiscretion sometime serves us well</LINE>

<LINE>There&#8217;s a divinity that shapes our ends,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Up from my cabin,</LINE>
<LINE>My sea-gown scarf&#8217;d about me, in the dark</LINE>
<LINE>Grop&#8217;d I to find out them, had my desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Finger&#8217;d their packet, and in fine withdrew</LINE>
<LINE>To mine own room again, making so bold,</LINE>
<LINE>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</LINE>
<LINE>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, royal knavery!&#8212;an exact command,</LINE>
<LINE>Larded with many several sorts of reasons,</LINE>
<LINE>Importing Denmark&#8217;s health and England&#8217;s too,</LINE>
<LINE>With, ho, such bugs and goblins in my life,</LINE>
<LINE>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</LINE>
<LINE>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</LINE>
<LINE>My head should be strook off.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Here&#8217;s the commission, read it at more leisure.</LINE>
<LINE>But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being thus benetted round with villainies,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I could make a prologue to my brains,</LINE>
<LINE>They had begun the play. I sat me down,</LINE>
<LINE>Devis&#8217;d a new commission, wrote it fair.</LINE>
<LINE>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</LINE>
<LINE>A baseness to write fair, and labor&#8217;d much</LINE>
<LINE>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</LINE>
<LINE>It did me yeman&#8217;s service. Wilt thou know</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; effect of what I wrote?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ay, good my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An earnest conjuration from the King,</LINE>
<LINE>As England was his faithful tributary,</LINE>
<LINE>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</LINE>
<LINE>As peace should still her wheaten garland wear</LINE>
<LINE>And stand a comma &#8217;tween their amities,</LINE>
<LINE>And many such-like as&#8217;s of great charge,</LINE>
<LINE>That on the view and knowing of these contents,</LINE>
<LINE>Without debatement further, more or less,</LINE>
<LINE>He should those bearers put to sudden death,</LINE>
<LINE>Not shriving time allow&#8217;d.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</LINE>
<LINE>I had my father&#8217;s signet in my purse,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</LINE>
<LINE>Folded the writ up in the form of th&#8217; other,</LINE>
<LINE>Subscrib&#8217;d it, gave&#8217;t th&#8217; impression, plac&#8217;d it safely,</LINE>
<LINE>The changeling never known. Now the next day</LINE>
<LINE>Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent</LINE>
<LINE>Thou knowest already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man, they did make love to this employment,</LINE>
<LINE>They are not near my conscience. Their defeat</LINE>
<LINE>Does by their own insinuation grow.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</LINE>
<LINE>Between the pass and fell incensed points</LINE>
<LINE>Of mighty opposites.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why, what a king is this!</LINE>

<LINE>Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>He that hath kill&#8217;d my king and whor&#8217;d my mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Popp&#8217;d in between th&#8217; election and my hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</LINE>
<LINE>And with such coz&#8217;nage&#8212;is&#8217;t not perfect conscience</LINE>
<LINE>To quit him with this arm? And is&#8217;t not to be damn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To let this canker of our nature come</LINE>
<LINE>In further evil?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be shortly known to him from England</LINE>
<LINE>What is the issue of the business there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It will be short; the interim&#8217;s mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And a man&#8217;s life&#8217;s no more than to say &#8220;one.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</LINE>
<LINE>That to Laertes I forgot myself,</LINE>
<LINE>For by the image of my cause I see</LINE>
<LINE>The portraiture of his. I&#8217;ll court his favors.</LINE>
<LINE>But sure the bravery of his grief did put me</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy state is the more gracious, for &#8217;tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the King&#8217;s mess. &#8217;Tis a chough, but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Exceedingly, my lord, it is very sultry&#8212;as &#8217;twere&#8212;I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that &#8217;a has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter&#8212;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes, believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society, and great showing; indeed, to speak sellingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dozy th&#8217; arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail; but in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s two of his weapons&#8212;but well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King, sir, hath wager&#8217;d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawn&#8217;d, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What call you the carriages?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides; I would it might be hangers till then. But on: six Barb&#8217;ry horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that&#8217;s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all impawn&#8217;d, as you call it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if I answer no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him and I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I deliver you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To this effect, sir&#8212;after what flourish your nature will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I commend my duty to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>&#8217;A does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for &#8217;s turn.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;A did comply, sir, with his dug before &#8217;a suck&#8217;d it. Thus has he, and many more of the same breed that I know the drossy age dotes on, only got the tune of the time, and out of an habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most profound and winnow&#8217;d opinions, and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Lord.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King&#8217;s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King and Queen and all are coming down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</LINE>

<LINE>You will lose, my lord.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. Thou wouldst not think how ill all&#8217;s here about my heart&#8212;but it is no matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If your mind dislike any thing, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit, we defy augury. There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, &#8217;tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come&#8212;the readiness is </LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A table prepar&#8217;d, and flagons of wine on it. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers with cushions, foils, daggers; King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and all the State.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The King puts Laertes&#8217; hand into Hamlet&#8217;s.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>But pardon&#8217;t as you are a gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>This presence knows,</LINE>
<LINE>And you must needs have heard, how I am punish&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With a sore distraction. What I have done</LINE>
<LINE>That might your nature, honor, and exception</LINE>
<LINE>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</LINE>
<LINE>Was&#8217;t Hamlet wrong&#8217;d Laertes? Never Hamlet!</LINE>
<LINE>If Hamlet from himself be ta&#8217;en away,</LINE>
<LINE>And when he&#8217;s not himself does wrong Laertes,</LINE>
<LINE>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.</LINE>
<LINE>Who does it then? His madness. If&#8217;t be so,</LINE>
<LINE>Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged,</LINE>
<LINE>His madness is poor Hamlet&#8217;s enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, in this audience,</LINE>
<LINE>Let my disclaiming from a purpos&#8217;d evil</LINE>
<LINE>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have shot my arrow o&#8217;er the house</LINE>
<LINE>And hurt my brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I am satisfied in nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose motive in this case should stir me most</LINE>
<LINE>To my revenge, but in my terms of honor</LINE>
<LINE>I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement</LINE>
<LINE>Till by some elder masters of known honor</LINE>
<LINE>I have a voice and president of peace</LINE>
<LINE>To keep my name ungor&#8217;d. But till that time</LINE>
<LINE>I do receive your offer&#8217;d love like love,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not wrong it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I embrace it freely,</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">Come, one for me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by this hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>You know the wager?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Very well, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Your Grace has laid the odds a&#8217; th&#8217; weaker side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not fear it, I have seen you both;</LINE>
<LINE>But since he is better&#8217;d, we have therefore odds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is too heavy; let me see another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This likes me well. These foils have all a length?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Prepare to play.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.</LINE>
<LINE>If Hamlet give the first or second hit,</LINE>
<LINE>Or quit in answer of the third exchange,</LINE>
<LINE>Let all the battlements their ord&#8217;nance fire.</LINE>
<LINE>The King shall drink to Hamlet&#8217;s better breath,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the cup an union shall he throw,</LINE>
<LINE>Richer than that which four successive kings</LINE>
<LINE>In Denmark&#8217;s crown have worn. Give me the cups,</LINE>
<LINE>And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,</LINE>
<LINE>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</LINE>
<LINE>The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Now the King drinks to Hamlet.&#8221; Come begin;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Trumpets the while.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</LINE>

<LINE>Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind me!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Absent thee from felicity a while,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain</LINE>
<LINE>To tell my story.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A march afar off and a shot within.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>What warlike noise is this?</LINE>

<LINE>Where is this sight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What is it you would see?</LINE>
<LINE>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,</LINE>
<LINE>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou so many princes at a shot</LINE>
<LINE>So bloodily hast strook?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. AMB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The sight is dismal,</LINE>
<LINE>And our affairs from England come too late.</LINE>
<LINE>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell him his commandment is fulfill&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Where should we have our thanks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Not from his mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Had it th&#8217; ability of life to thank you.</LINE>
<LINE>He never gave commandement for their death.</LINE>
<LINE>But since so jump upon this bloody question,</LINE>
<LINE>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</LINE>
<LINE>Are here arrived, give order that these bodies</LINE>
<LINE>High on a stage be placed to the view,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me speak to th&#8217; yet unknowing world</LINE>
<LINE>How these things came about. So shall you hear</LINE>
<LINE>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</LINE>
<LINE>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</LINE>
<LINE>Of deaths put on by cunning and forc&#8217;d cause,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this upshot, purposes mistook</LINE>
<LINE>Fall&#8217;n on th&#8217; inventors&#8217; heads: all this can I</LINE>
<LINE>Truly deliver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Let us haste to hear it,</LINE>
<LINE>And call the noblest to the audience.</LINE>
<LINE>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.</LINE>
<LINE>I have some rights, of memory in this kingdom,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.</LINE>
<LINE>But let this same be presently perform&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Even while men&#8217;s minds are wild, lest more mischance</LINE>
<LINE>On plots and errors happen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Let four captains</LINE>
<LINE>Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,</LINE>
<LINE>For he was likely, had he been put on,</LINE>
<LINE>To have prov&#8217;d most royal; and for his passage,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldiers&#8217; music and the rite of war</LINE>
<LINE>Speak loudly for him.</LINE>
<LINE>Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</LINE>
<LINE>Go bid the soldiers shoot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordinance are shot off.</STAGEDIR>
